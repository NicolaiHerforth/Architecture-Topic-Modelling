For their week-long takeover our friends @crookedstave have a cooler at the BRUS shop dedicated to their funky, hoppy, sour, barrel aged bottles. Those bottles include the awesome L'brett series - an array of Golden Sour Ales with tons of added fruits & aged in oak barrels. 
All bottles are in limited amounts so be sure to come by to get yours! 
The shop is open 12:00-21:00 everyday #🍺
