Race day 😎
My best half marathon yet! Not just time wise, but it was pretty relaxed and I was chatting with my buddy during the entire race. I had energy surplus the whole way, and was able to run faster the last couple of kilometers 💪 The race was Copenhagen Coast Half, arranged by @trailmandk for the first time. It was a great race with some mud and  deep puddles along the way - I believe I was in water almost to my knee at one point!
There was also quite a headwind for some kilometers,but it all added nicely to the race experience 😀

Avg pulse ?, pace 5:01, ☝️ 64m, week/month total 40k/244k
