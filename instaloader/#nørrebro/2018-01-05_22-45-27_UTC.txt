Mads had been a #gymnast and #gymnastics #instructor at the #GymnasticsAssociationGefion in Copenhagen for 11 years, but then studied dancing at the #Balettakademien (#BalletAcademy) in #Gothenburg, #Sweden where he also became fluent in Swedish. Then, Mads was a professional #dancer for 8 years in the #MicadoDanceEnsemble. @Wikipedia •

“While I was still dancing, I realized that I preferred the drama part of dancing over the aesthetics. And then I had the idea of dedicating myself to #drama and apply for a spot at #dramaschool [1992]. And yes, then I became an actor [in #Aarhus, at the school at #AarhusTheater]. I’ve never regretted it, I love my profession, I’m very ambitious about it and it has become my dream. It just wasn’t my dream when I was a kid.” - MM

*"I'm old dancing, and one of the first places I traveled was #NewYork as a young, 18-year-old. It was a totally insane trip to take, because, I had only been to #Malmö [City in #Sweden] until then. Everything I had seen in movies and TV shows became real and real, and then I just dreamed about being dancing and practicing and maybe acting over there." - MM

“I spent six months in New York training as a dancer [at Martha Graham's summer school in 1984]. I studied ballet actually. It was rare for a boy to dance. I came from a working class area [Nørrebro] where no one had ever seen a dance performance and I never dreamt of being a dancer. I saw ‘Singing In The Rain’ and loved it, but I didn’t discuss that with my friends. You don’t do that in a working class family. It took me many years before I ever told anyone what I actually did at work.“ - MM

*When Mads Mikkelsen finished at the Drama Theater at Aarhus Theater [Aarhus, Denmark] in 1996, and in his first feature film, #NicolasWindingRefn's #Pusher, he dreamed instead of making #DanishFilm.
