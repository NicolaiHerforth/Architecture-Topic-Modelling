It's time for another exploration of coffee where you will be able to learn about the process from the coffee cherry to a roasted bean.

Let's meet at 4th of February from 12-14 o'clock at Impact Roasters (Langgade Station), and explore what influence coffee flavor while at the same time roasting and tasting coffee together.
