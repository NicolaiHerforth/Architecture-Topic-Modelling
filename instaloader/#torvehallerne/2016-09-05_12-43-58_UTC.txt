Last but definitely not least we had hazelnuts from Piemonte with myseost (Norwegian type of sweet brown cheese) and biodynamic hay milk. Everything just came together and complemented each other in this dish. The milk foam was light, pure, and fresh, the myseost was sweet, caramelly, and creamy, and the hazelnuts gave a good crunch and another lovely taste to finish off a great evening. #magasinetlækkerier #søllerødkro #copenhagencooking #copenhagen #københavn #torvehallerne #dessertaften #hazelnuts #hasselnødder #piemonte #myseost #hømælk #haymilk #lastbutnotleast #canilicktheplate #måmanslikketallerkenen
