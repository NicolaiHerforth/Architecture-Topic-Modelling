Thanks to @groedcph and @manfredscph  for favorite meals in Copenhagen. @groedcph  staying by your Torvehallerne location meant I ate there three times (which was still not enough). @manfredscph thanks for novel and local vegetarian and meat dishes, fabulous service, and the tasting of orange wines.
