Meet Alemu, one of our coffee beans producer. He is a hard-working coffee farmer who owns a small-scale farm in South Ethiopia. Like most farmers in Ethiopia, Alemu depends on the small farm to take care of his family. Now the coffee season is coming, and the coffee trees started bearing fruits. Alemu expects a higher yield this season. At Impact Roasters, we pay coffee farmers a higher price. But that is not the only thing we are doing. We do Impact by creating projects for lasting changes. We call it ''Impact Trade''.
