Second session today was a skill focused two-piece workout.
A) AMRAP 20 of 2 RMU and 6 dumbbell OHS (30kg/70lbs)
B) 3 RFQ of 15 alt. dumbbell snatch (30kg/70lbs) with switch in the ground.

The A-piece would've been conditioning work if RMU's weren't such a skill/strength bottleneck and the OHS had been a bit lighter. I managed 12 rounds+2 RMU (26 RMU and 72 OHS) while only pushing my rest times in the last 5 minutes. Obviously still a glaring weakness, but I made some good technique improvements. I found a much tighter spot to hit in my kip that made the turnover much faster.
