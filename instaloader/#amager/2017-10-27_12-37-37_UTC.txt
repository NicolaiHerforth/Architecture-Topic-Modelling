Today I got a huge bone, because I went to the veterinarian, something with my ears......because I love water...... I was so good at the vet, and got lots of treats while the vet put stuff in my ears, I made no sounds at all.  I weigh 31.5kg a big boy now :) and back to the vet Friday for a checkup...... and perhaps a new bone from the butcher, I love it 🐾💙🇩🇰 #vet #vetenarian #butcher #slagter #holmbladsgade #amager #amagerbro #amagercenter #amar #hund #puppy #boy #f1labrador #lab #labrador #labradorable #black #blacklabrador #dog #dogs #pet #pets #smile #bone #ben #meat #kød
