In a land obsessed with morning pastries, Lauras takes the cake. Using the classic Danish kanelsnegl (cinnamon bun) as a base, a selection of signature Danish pastries was created. The design here draws on the nostalgia of grandmother's cakes and bread, integrated with the combination of a modern metropolitan vibe with a minimalistic Scandinavian aesthetic.

This is our chokolade snegl (chocolate swirl) and cinnabun snegl (cinnabun swirl). These, together with the thickly frosted cinnamon rolls, and Poptart-reminiscent hindbærsnitte are sure to make any sweet tooth tingle.
