For ages the central Copenhagen postal sorting office has been one of the prominent sights you first met when arriving by train. As a mixture between a modernist temple and a factory it's now coming to an end as demolition is speeding up to give space for a new Lundgaard & Tranberg designed business and leisure area. Designed 1966 by the architects Holm & Grut the Postterminal was finished 1979
