Photos by Kyle John - As of September 2017 I joined the team as their new TAQUERO in training and should I pass my exam eventually as the Managing Director.

Together with Rosio, the board of directors and other co-owners, I continue the quest to make the very best Mexican food around Europe and make it available to more potential fans.

We aim to win the fans who does appreciate the authentic and no compromise approach quality, but we also hope that a smile and a sample will win new as time goes.
