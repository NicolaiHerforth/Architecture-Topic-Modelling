#kastrupsøbad is a wooden island on stilts offering some wind protection and the opportunity to jump directly into the deeper part of the baltic rather than wading into the potentially cold sea. In summer, the round fort-like shape creates a lively and crowded atmosphere of people sunbathing, jumping and having a pique-nique. In winter its a solemn location for winter bathers.⠀

How much a few lights can do to turn a wet and cold winter night into #hygge : #torvehallerne on #israelsplads in #copenhagen at night. They combine grocery shopping with a dining and snacking experience.⠀
