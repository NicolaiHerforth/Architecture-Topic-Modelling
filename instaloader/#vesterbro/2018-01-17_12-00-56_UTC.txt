In Groove dance we don’t care what you look like as you are OK and perfect the way you are! And you should look different because you are UNIQUE and nobody is like you… So we dance together to simple and easy moves BUT you dance in your own way and have a lot of freedom to style it as YOU. That’s why I love Groove dance! It’s easy, simple, super fun and you can be YOU! You can move, express yourself, enjoy yourself and connect with yourself and others. It’s authentic dance. Come and connect with your authenticity and your essence!
We start a course of 7 classes on this Saturday, 20 January at 14:00. (Vesterbro Kulturhus).
There are some lovely ladies signed up already, so grab your spot today and join us! You will be happy for investing in yourself in this way… I promise.
