First round of this Jelling (with hints of Mammen) style half sleeve, strictly based on the golden ornaments on the SÃ¸llested harness bow (on display at the National Museum in Copenhagen). The piece will eventually cover the shoulder, pectoral and shoulder blade.

Contact me if you are interested in a fully customised piece that rigorously follows the authentic nordic styles (especially Jelling and Mammen)

Thanks for looking
