Veja shoes are made with a love and honesty that is difficult to find in a sneaker economy that is dominated by players at the top of the corporate ladder. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
The guys at Veja do not cut corners, when they say ecological & sustainable - they really mean it. Even sacrificing their entire advertising budget to invest in an honest production process. Veja collaborate at ground level with organic cotton farmers in Brazil and wild rubber tappers from the Amazon to bring you a quality, affordable and environmentally sustainable shoe!
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
On top of all that, they’re pretty damn sweet to look at and wear too! ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
We have other colours and styles available in store on Elmegade 3 and at nativenorth.dk ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
