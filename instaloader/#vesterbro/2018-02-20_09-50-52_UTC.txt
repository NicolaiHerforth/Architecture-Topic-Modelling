This Tuesdays health(y) survival tip is Lavender. Pretty much everybody knows about the relaxing and soothing benefits of this beautiful plant. Do you know you can also use it to make a calming drink? Behold my LOVELY LAVENDER lemonade 🙌🏾👩🏽‍🍳🍹
The recipe was published previously in @madogvenner. Be careful to balance it out though. The essential lavender oil can be really strong, so use sparingly. Too much and it smells / tastes like your grannies perfume:
👉🏽1 cup raw agave syrup or raw honey. 👉🏽12 cups of coconut water, or if you don’t like that, normal clear water. 👉🏽1 drop lavender essential oil. 👉🏽6 lemons. 👉🏽Lavender to garnish.

Mix all ingredients together and put in the fridge. Add more agave or honey, if you like.
