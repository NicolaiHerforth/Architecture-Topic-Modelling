This Tuesdays health(y) survival tip is the 'Miracle Tree' Moringa Oleifera, also known as horseradish tree, ben tree, or drumstick tree. It grows in countries like India and Pakistan, but also on "my island" Curaçao. Moringa has been praised for its health benefits for thousands of years. This tree is one of the world's most exciting natural and nutritional plant. It is valued worldwide for its ability to treat over 300 diseases and contains over 90 nutrients. Nutritional analyses show that the leaves are very high in protein and contain all of the essential amino acids. Moringa is packed with essential vitamins and minerals, especially vitamins A and C. Its benefits include providing antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds, balancing hormones and slowing the effects of aging, improving digestive health, balancing blood sugar levels and helping fight diabetes, protecting and nourishing the skin, and helping stabilize mood and protect brain health. Put simply, on a gram for gram basis, studies show Moringa contains three times more potassium than bananas, four times more vitamin A than carrots, four times the calcium found in milk, seven times more vitamin C than oranges, and nine times the iron of spinach!

My mother introduced the tea to me and it helps to stay calm in stressful times, but also not to feel drowsy, but actually energetic. Take it in the morning, and you're good to go! Featured product is just the one I am using now, not sponsored.
