At Impact Roasters, we believe that it is important to invest in job creation projects for the youth that resides in the areas where our coffee comes from. One of the projects that we have carried out through our nonprofit organization called Coffeeprint4Change is a concrete block production facility that employs local young men and women committed to being part of our aim to change and shape the local community. The training has already taken place, and now Coffeeprint4Change plans to develop other projects such as building schools, sanitation, facilities, libraries and other constructions that are needed to impact the whole community positively.
