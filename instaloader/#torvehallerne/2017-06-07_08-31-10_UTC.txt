Day 2 of #BBMxDREAMTRIP: Our first morning in Copenhagen was rainy and gloomy. Porridge sounded like a good idea in this weather. I remembered @oregongirl_aroundtheworld mentioning something about GRÃ˜D and decided to try it out. It looked so weird and I hesitated for a while before putting it in my mouth. But it was good! Not too shabby a choice for my first Copenhagen breakfast. ðŸ˜‹
