🎂🇩🇰🎉It is live! The celebration has started in the coffee shops. Swing by for a coffee drink for 10 kr. where the money goes directly to Kieni, Kenya!  If you are interested in paying more than 10 Kr. for your coffee drink, then the contribution will go directly to Kieni as well. The goal is to fulfill the two wishes ranking highest at Kieni: Drying beds in metal and a moisture meter. Stop by and buy a coffee! There is also a discount in the webshop: 20% off on coffee bags. Link in bio to website 🙌🎉🎂🇩🇰
