A bit of some of the many amazing details on the old library building of Copenhagen University in Inner Copenhagen. This is the main entrance of the building that was build between 1857 and 1861. It's a real gem for brick lovers and supposed to be equally beautiful on the inside. I've never seen it but the peaks I get through the windows tells me it's true. #indreby #delditkbh #mursten #mageløstmurværk #københavnsuniversitet #ku #fiolstræde #fiolstræde1 #universitetsbiblioteket #bricks #ihavethisthingwithbricks
