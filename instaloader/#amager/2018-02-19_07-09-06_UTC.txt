I  want to get in better shape so I used the sunrise this morning as an excuse to to for a walk and take a few photos. Worked like a charm. Amager’s beach park is so beautiful at sunrise and I greeted the winter bathers as I walked in on a them at their hangout in “the snail”, as their building is called.
