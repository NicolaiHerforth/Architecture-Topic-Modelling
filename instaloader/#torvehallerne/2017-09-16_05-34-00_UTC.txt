My day starts early.  That's the way I like it.  I’m definitely a morning person, however I do my best work at night. ✨
My early mornings are spent on a run or at yoga. Followed by a short sprint writing in My Morning Pages journal.  This is time I have blocked out to clear my head to be ready for the day. ✨
My schedule makes for a long day.  I work to fill it to the brim with the things I love to do.  I wish the same for you.
