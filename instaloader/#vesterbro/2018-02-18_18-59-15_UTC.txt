Best hotdog in Copenhagen? At home, when Iâ€™m serving the legendary Iâ€™ll Be Damned Dog (a wiener homage to @illbedamnedrock) with a bun wrapped in bacon! Yeah, not kidding - itâ€™s for real. On the dog youâ€™ll find caramelized onions with melted cheddar, a mustard-picalilli dressing, ketchup, crispy fried onions, relish, and crushed paprika chips. This, in all humbleness, is a majestic hotdog, courtesy of yours truly.
