Vestre Kirkegård. In ancient Greece (a society based on slavery), it was common to depict a mourning slave, unsure of her future after the death of her master. In late 1800s Denmark, slavery was officially abolished. But nevertheless the motif can be found in more than 20 statues from 1895 to 1920. In modified form, but often with subtle slave-alike attributes, like oil lamp, barefooted and scantily clad. In real life, women were still sort of “slaves” to men: legally with rights of children, without right to vote, or candidate for elections. This changed 1915, and the number of statues of this sort accordingly declined and disappeared. Men showing feelings was considered a weakness until the 1900s. Photo taken pre-dusk on a rainy day, to trigger the flash.
