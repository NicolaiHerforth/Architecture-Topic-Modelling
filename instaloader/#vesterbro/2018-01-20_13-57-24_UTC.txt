Read about Hannes experience with practicing Bikram Hot Yoga. Hanne is 49 years old and has practised Bikram Yoga for 19 months.

She comes to class 1-2 times a week.

Q: Describe a Bikram Class in your own words:

A: Bikram is a sweaty and very focused session for me, in a good way. I enjoy the focus that it demands to fulfill the different posts.

My heart rate goes up, and I focus on breathing through my nose and try to keep it slow.

Q: Have you noticed any changes in body and/or mind since you started practicing?

A: I have for many years suffered from the "Restless Legs Syndrome" (my legs were kicking uncontrolled, especially before going to bed, I took Ibuprofen to calm down my legs so I was able to fall asleep.
Now that I practise Bikram I hardly ever have restless legs (maybe once a month, before I had it almost every night)

I am able to run up hill now (before Bikram my legs were soooooo heavy, couldnÂ´t manage to run up hill, now I think it's fun to run up hill, just because I can. 
Twice a week I play badminton, my very first experience playing badminton after my first Bikram session was really wauuu, my legs were flying on court, such a great feeling.

My skin has become softer/smoother

More flexible, better balance, better sleep (nice energy the day after). Q: Anything you would like to say or add?" A: I appreciate the good atmosphere in the studio. 
Nice changing rooms, nice warm tea after the session. 
And the studio is located close to the Central Station, which is very convenient for me.

And last but not least, well qualified teachers with good energy, they see you and helps you to do the posts correctly.
