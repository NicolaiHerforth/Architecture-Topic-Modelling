Copenhagen Food Crawl:
One of my all time favorite eats is the Lobster Roll. So when I heard you could get this crustacean filled hot dog at Hooked in Nørrebro, Copenhagen, I couldn’t let the opportunity slip.

It was a little more elaborate than the lobster rolls I’ve had in the states, with the crunchy fried onions on top, and the lovely buttersoaked bun, but it had about a tenth of the lobster meat than the US version. But then again - this ain’t Maine. Lobsters are a rare and expensive thing here in Denmark, so I can understand them being skimpy on the meat. Nevertheless despite this being a pricy thing, it was delicious, and enough to satisfy my lobster cravings for a while.

Hooked also serves fish burgers and fish and chips amongst other things, and I will definately be back to sample more from their menu 👍🏻
