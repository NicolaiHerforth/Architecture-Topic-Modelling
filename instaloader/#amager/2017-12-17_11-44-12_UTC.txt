Change is the spice of life: today I went to the other side of my island (#Amager) to run and watch the #sunrise 😊 It was a beautiful morning but quite slippery on some of the paths. Took good care and had a nice 10 km social run and jogged home in a great mood 🏃🏼‍♀️😊 #run #runnerslife #running #runninggirl #nofilter #copenhagen #københavn #københavnerjyde #løb #træning #oresundsbron
