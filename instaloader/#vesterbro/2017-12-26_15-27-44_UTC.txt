❤️ ✌️ every day. @ninasativa52 @moonlightsky4. I am still waiting for peace. Many beautiful people out there. I do not dress up like this in my dayly life. Still I see many people doing it. 🇩🇰 I do not know where all of them are coming from. I do know once they had their own place where all women before marriage and some after, could where this with out being called all kind of things. Just like me. My wish is that we will make peace with kulturelle aktiviteter in the 🌍 we are one yes. We have a heart. We have kids. We have fear. Love them and do not want to know that somewhere our men are fighting for the same dream peace and harmonie to be free. #personaltrainer #peace #vesterbro #world #newyear
