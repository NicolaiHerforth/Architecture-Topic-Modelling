📕 Fastelavn or Carneval- I’m sure someone with historical expertise can fill in the gaps, so here it goes..... Fastelavn is the festival that comes before Ash Wednesday and celebrates the begining of the 40 day fast up to Easter 🐣, where meat and wheat we’re forbidden. 🍗🥖
One of the weird fastelavn traditions we still celebrate in Denmark is an old one. In the 1500s the Dutch brought the tradition of hitting a black cat out of a barrel on Fastelavn to Denmark. 🐱 Hitting a living cat out of a barrel was believed to protect us from evil spirits. 👻
In Denmark we still hit the ‘cat’ out of the barrel, but of course not a living one. 🇩🇰 🤷🏼‍♀️ #weirdtraditions
.
Stay tuned for next year, where I’ll bring, why we dress up in costumes and why we hit people and animals with tree branches. 😅🌿
