"What we can do, is sometimes to choose not to do, be and not fix quite as much. We women need to remember to reach out and ask for help. We don’t need to do or bare everything ourselves, but we do have an obligation to help one another, to be there for one another and a duty to practise as much care for ourselves, so that we actually have enough care to share with those we love. We´ve got each other, and we need to take care of one another. For us, SISTER LOVE is the mantra of 2018.” Founders of moshi moshi mind Rikke Rasmussen and Stine Skjoldborg.
