My first taste of Smorrebrod, a traditional Danish open-faced sandwich. It uses rye bread, and a huge variety of ingredients to top it. An important aspect is that the sandwich should be pretty too, like this shrimp and fishcake Smorrebrod that I had. #smorrebrod #torvehallerne #hallernessmørrebrød #smørrebrød #copenhagen #denmark #pescetarian #foodmarket #shrimp #fishcake #ryebread
