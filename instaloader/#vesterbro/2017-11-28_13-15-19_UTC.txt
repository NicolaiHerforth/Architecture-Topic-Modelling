I'm still not getting any night time sleep because of my little baby tornado. Gluten free carrot cake, turmeric tea, and a feminist manifesto on how to raise a mindful feminist and strong kid are my lifesavers today. The book was given to me by my awesome sister Anne @rocksandrabbit Such an important and inspiring read.
