I went on a book hunt today. First store didn't have it, so I thought to myself, weather is good, I'll just walk to another store 2,4 km away. Got there, bought the book, decided to walk home. Another 3,1 km, and guess what...... It started raining. ğŸŒ§ I was soaked when I got home and my feet are killing me. Did walk a total of 8,44 km, so no wonder they hurt ğŸ™ˆ #walk #rain #nature #sÃ¸ndermarken #sÃ¸ndag #sunday #gÃ¥tur #bookhunt #fÃ¸tex #regn #denmark #danmark #kÃ¸benhavn #valby #copenhagen #frederiksberg #nofilterneeded #nofilter #autumn #efterÃ¥r #november
