IF, IF, IF...There was a "MADS MIKKELSEN MUSEUM" located in Nørrebro, Denmark [with a 'Hannibal' Theatre, of course], these are "some" of the casual pieces (with one exception) that are synonymous with Mads, and are just as famous! So, I thought, the following items could make it into his Wardrobe "Hall of Fame!"
●
The "Daddy Cool" Leather Jacket (Cannes, France 2012 and 2016) •
•
The Cargo Jeans/Pants (many pockets) and Shoes •
•
The Blue Striped Hoody
•
The Many Layers of Plaid Shirts and Cargo Jeans
•
The Orange Adidas™ Mens' "Porsche Design" Spacer Mesh Jackets and the Stretch Jeans
•
The Orange Nike™ Hoody (Hideo Kojima has one as a "Mads' Clue" Decoy), and All the Sunglasses that he wears on top of his head
•
The Adidas™Athletic Jackets and Sports Shoes, and His different Caps/Hats
•
The No. 9 Black Hoody
•
The Pink Hoody (Belongs to Roland Møller, though)
•
The Infamous 'Hannibal' Garrison Bespoke™ Tailored (Person) Suit
•
...And a Generous Amount of Art, Paintings, Sculptures, Artifacts, etc., in the other wing of the Museum. •
