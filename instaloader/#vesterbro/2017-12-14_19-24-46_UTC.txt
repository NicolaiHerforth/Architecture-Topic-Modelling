Kære Tove...
I arrived very late to Tove Ditlevsen’s work if I’m honest (especially if I’m not allowed to include the memorial beer garden in her name at Klubben on #Enghavevej in Copenhagen). But having finally gotten around to reading some of her work earlier this year, notably this novel, ‘Gift’, I’m a newly convinced disciple. 
This is the one book which had the biggest impact on me in 2017 (and I think I read The Tidal Zone this year). ‘Gift’ means both ‘poison’ and ‘married’ in Danish, and this recounting of the author’s marriages and drug addiction, published a few years before her suicide in 1976, absolutely took my breath away, both in terms of its literary achievement and the urgency of the story. 
It’s incredible that this is not available in English (I don’t believe any of her work is currently in print in English, but look up the hashtag #toveditlevsen on Instagram right now and, even if you don’t understand the text, you’ll get an idea of how much her work means in Denmark). Whilst Nordisk Books’ main vocation is contemporary fiction, we’re not averse to 20th century modern genius (cf Tom Kristensen), so maybe we’ll have to have a look at this in 2019 (the diary’s looking busy next year with three titles already slated!). As Tove herself wrote (excuse the hack translation): ‘Strange is our disposition - 
We love most, that which is long gone.’ #toveditlevsen100år #toveditlevsensmindehave #danishliterature #copenhagen #vesterbro
