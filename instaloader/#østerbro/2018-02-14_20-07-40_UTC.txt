Let me tell you a little secret of mine.. I’ve found that it starts by investing in who we already are. At the end of the day you’re your longest commitment before befreinding the idea of giving to others. But when you get to that pivotal moment, then you are ready. Maybe today we ought to spread the love a little to family, freinds and loved ones. There are so many takes on a day like this, so go out there and make it your own.
