Flashback to summertime. The light- and colour spectrum changes so much during the year here in Denmark. This picture is from my Dad's garden. I grew up here and it is one of my favorite places in the world. Every time I visit, I do my round in the garden. Checking how everything is doing, which flowers are blooming, watching the life around the bird feeders, taking in the scents and remembering times gone by.
