BRUS beer No. 1, Namastave, our collab with @crookedstave, is still pouring at the bar. Barrel aged on Chardonnay barrels from the day we opened a year and a half ago, this saison is the perfect combination of fruity, tartness with funky, wine notes. Bar is open til midnight tonight which gives plenty of time to sip this one down and prep for the new year.
