All alone - Dragør is a little old town and former fishing village just situated 12 km from Copenhagen on the scenic east cost of the island of Amager. Dragør is a municipality in Copenhagen County with a population of nearly 14,000 - and the only town on the isle of Amager. Most of the charming yellow houses were built side by side in the 18th century - with a maze of streets and alleys.  Dragør’s history dates back to the 12 century - where the town is founded and later became an important fishing port that grew naturally in size due to its location by the Sound and Baltic Sea. Around year 1380 - the Hanseatic League was given some trade privileges in Dragør town - which expanded the city as an imperative fishing port for one of the largest fishing fleets in Denmark that supplied the growing fishing industry with raw fish from the increasing coastal fishing for the production of preserved fishand seafood for consumption. Today the catch is exported to larger sea ports in Denmark for further processing.
