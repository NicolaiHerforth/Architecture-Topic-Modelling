For the Sunday afternoon cafe, you should try some of the lovely handmade caramels from Karamelleriet. Based in Nørrebro Copenhagen but originally from the super nice island of Bornholm. Their caramels are beautifully wrapped and lovely tasting. And of course for sale in my webshop end of the month. #karamelleriet #nørrebro #bornholm @karamelleriet ☕️🍬
