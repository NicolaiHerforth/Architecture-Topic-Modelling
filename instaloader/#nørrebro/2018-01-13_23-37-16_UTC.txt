Dumplings and Tofu - Gao Dumpling Bar - The dumpling  skins tasted great and mixed well with each distinct filling. Each dumpling had a sauce to match and the deep fried tofu was coated in a classic sriracha mayo. Pro-tip: The Spicy Pork dumplings came in a soy sauce and hóng yóu combination, which was a great sauce to use on the other dumplings #nørrebro #copenhagen #copenhagenfood #denmark #dumplings #chinese #chinesefood #foodstyling #food#foodphotography #travel #placestoeat #baconrollsetcdk #bacontollsetc
