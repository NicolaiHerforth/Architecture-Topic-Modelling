Something new, blue and borrowed. The "Stay Copenhagen" building looks brand new. In fact, it's a business hotel from 1960 by architect Thorvald Dreyer called "The A House" - due to its shape. In 2010 it was completely transformed by Holgaard Architects. Now it's an apartment building with a very spacious rooftop terrace. #holgaardarchitects #islandsbrygge #copenhagen #amager #architecture #architettura #architects #architectura #architecturestudents #architecturestudent #architectureporn #architecturelover #architecturelovers #newarchitecture #modernarchitecture #architecturephoto #delditkbh #wonderlustcopenhagen #architecture_hunter
