You asked for it, you got it. After quite a few people have come through requesting it, we're pleased to finally have @peoplelikeusdk on the shelves. A brewery run by autists, with know how from @mikkellerbeer, this is quite a revolutionary concept. Hell's Saison is a rye saison, and we've got it chilled or to go. Only real question is, whats holding you? #craftbeer #PeopleLikeUs #Mikkeller #saison #rye #MikkellerAndFriendsBottleShop  #TorvehallerneKBH
