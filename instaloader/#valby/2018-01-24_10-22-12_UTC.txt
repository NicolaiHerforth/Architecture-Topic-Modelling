My days home with Luah is about to end. I’ll be starting in new jobs next week and my last semester on bachelor level begins soon after - I’m so excited to start so many new things in the field of my interest but I’m also scared for this little girl starting her daycare life.

Thankfully she still has a month in the company of our great family that helps out doing February where we are juggling four jobs, my last semester and a family life 🤹🏼‍♀️
