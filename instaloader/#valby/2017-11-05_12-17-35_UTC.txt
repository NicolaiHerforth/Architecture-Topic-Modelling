Planting garlic. I mainly do this for the early shoots which come early March - but the fresh bulbs in June are also i treat. While these are planted on the balcony, I also have a small container with just 3 cloves inside. They grow fast and Will give me shoots to sprinkle on salad all winter. #gr√∏nttorvet #altan #balconytotable #balcony #altanliv #altanhave #balconygardening #organicgardening #valby #urbanorganicgardener
