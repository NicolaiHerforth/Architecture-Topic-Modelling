Enghavevej, Copenhagen V

It is Christmas time and all I want for Christmas when it comes to urban space and buildings is that they keep this small area on Enghavevej. So we can still show our kids just a fraction of what the old Vesterbro looked liked or just for the pleasure of enjoying this not so ordinary sight when passing through

We cannot afford to tear it all down even if it is not prestigious buildings and obvious heritage.
