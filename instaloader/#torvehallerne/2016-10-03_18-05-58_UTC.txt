One of the things I really are going to miss in Greenland is the possibility to buy smørrebrød(high open faced sandwich) 
Here is a picture from today when, my girlfriend and I went out enjoying the good smørrebrød at torvehallerne in Copenhagen. 
Smørrebrød is a Danish national dish with ryebread served with several different kinds of meat and vegetables. Here you can forinstence see chickensalad with bacon, egg and shrimps, egg and herring, and one with potatoes.
