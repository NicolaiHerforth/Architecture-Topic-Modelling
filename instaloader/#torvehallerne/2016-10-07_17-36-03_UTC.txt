Today i went to one of my weekend coffee places, and had a smooth cortardo made with a soft, well steamed milk! The coffee was strong, bitter and the taste of hard roasted #coffeebeans!  It's the all and only #coffeecollective in #torvehallerne. It's a nice spot to hang out, and if your on the run, a lovely tasty moment in this caffeebar is well spend. :-) #coffeedk #recommendable !
