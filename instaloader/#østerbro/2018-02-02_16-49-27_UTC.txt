The backside of the old municipal hospital of Copenhagen, now closed and a part of Copenhagen University. 
I was in the basement of one of the buildings. Not just a regular basement, but a basement of over 2000 square metres! It was built and was ready as a Royal hostpital in case of a third world war or a nuclear war. Enormous basement!
