Seasons change. What is your relation to change happening to places around you? Do you resist it or do you embrace it? Do you pioneer it? Do you feel it, maybe even anticipate it? Do you know why, do you really know, and do you stop to feel and reflect about why you feel like you do and what you are going to do about it? Who knows, maybe you will change your pathway and the story you tell. Maybe you will just discover a place you care for, enough to take action.
