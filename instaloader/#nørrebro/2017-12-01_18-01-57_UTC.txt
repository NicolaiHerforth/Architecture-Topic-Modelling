Get your very own Christmas tree from the square outside the BRUS shop every Saturday & Sunday leading up to Christmas from 12:00-16:00, starting this weekend! We’ll be serving glögg and rom toddy buddys in the cold too (and æbleskiver inside).
The Nordmann trees are from a small, sustainable farm in Djursland, where they have lived a happy and healthy life surrounded by singing birds, fresh air and absolutely no pesticides.
