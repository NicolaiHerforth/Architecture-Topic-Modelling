I just ðŸ’šfood markets. Wherever I travel I try to seek out the best ones, i e Les Halles in Biarritz, Borough Market in London or just the never ending fruit ang veg, nuts and spices of Levinsky in Tel Aviv...
This all year round stand outside Torvehallerne in Copenhagen makes me so happy! I just want to take all of it home with me. Not sure How happy @nobishotelcopenhagen would be if I filled my 4 poster bed with veggies though.
