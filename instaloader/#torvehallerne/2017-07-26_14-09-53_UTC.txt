When in Rome ... lining up with all the locals at Hallernes Smørrebrød for a "fiskefilet," i.e., a piece of crumbed flounder on pumpernickel bread with a creamy mayonnaise sauce, capers, fresh dill & a squirt of lemon 👌🏼 Late afternoon, sitting outside in the sun at Torvehallerne market next to the fresh flower stand eating my smørrebrød whilst listening to music & people watching, I couldn't be happier 🌞🌻😊 #wheninrome #locals #fiskefilet #crumbedfish #flounder #pumpernickel #creamy #mayo #capers #dill #lemon #lateafternoon #alfresco #sun #market #flowerstand #smorrebrod #music #peoplewatching #happyplace #torvehallerne #copenhagen #denmark #scandinavia #summer
