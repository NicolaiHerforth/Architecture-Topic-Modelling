Finally tried a smørrebrød (open-faced sandwich) at Torvehallen food market and it highly exceeded expectations. Recommend the laks dish -  citrus-marinated salmon with fennel cream, lemon and dill on dark rye bread. Incredibly fresh, amazing burst of flavours and tasted like a sunny Summer's day. 👌🏽🐟
