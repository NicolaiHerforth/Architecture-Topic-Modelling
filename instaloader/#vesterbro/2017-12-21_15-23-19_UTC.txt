Merry x-mas from STED! We have been exploring our local neighborhood Vesterbro and collected findings, stories and senses. With this we wish to all a very merry Christmas and a happy new year where we encourage you to keep wondering and be curious about spaces! #merrychristmas #christmascards #architecture #landscape #landscapearchictecture #urbanplanning #spaces #storytelling #cabinetofcuriosities #exploringlocallife #vesterbro #ilovecph #stedcph
