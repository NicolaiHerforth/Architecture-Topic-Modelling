Wishing I had a cup of @coffeecollectif this afternoon. 
The map behind the bar shows the farmers who produce the coffee; directly trading with the roasters ensuring an above average and ultimately fair price for their coffee. The coffee tastes great and refreshing to know the farmers are being treated fairly through this direct trade.
