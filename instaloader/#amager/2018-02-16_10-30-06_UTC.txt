Review 1405 - The Mortician - Amager Brygghus / Barrier - Imperial Stout - ABV 10.5% - Bottle from @boxbeerscom - Today this beast is released here in Sweden and Danish @amagerbryghus has teamed up with @barrier_brewing_co for a collab. The beer itself is a mix of Barrier's Morticia and Amager's Hr.Fredriksen with an added touch of smoked malts and coffee. Luckily (for me) the smoked malts aren't the setting factor here. Aroma is roasted malty with licorice, chocolates and coffee. A wee bit of smoke. Taste is thick and roasted with licorice and some smoke. Coffee bitterness. I have (as you know?) some troubles with smoked malts, but here it's alright. Actually, this is my second bottle even, and I'm bumping it a little, as I appreciated it a little bit more this time around. Maybe it needed some time to settle? 4.0/5.0 #amager #amagerbryghus #barrierbrewing #themortician #imperialstout #danishcraftbeer #americancraftbeer #boxbeerscom #drinkitlikeyoumeanit #thebeernation #hopmaestro #boxbeers
