My goal for this year was to reach 200kg / 420 lbs in deadlift. I started to lift 200kg with straps, and as you see in the video I did another attempt with mixed grip. The technique is okay, but as you can my back is not straight enough. My program has been with 3 times deadlift a week with variations of paused deadlift and Romanian deadlift as well. My squat haven’t got any attention because of deadlifting in my program, but I’ve done a lot of movements for my back and of course bench press and overhead press. My body weight is around 77-79kg. The band is ‘StarGazer’ from Australia. Haven’t seen them live yet. Hopefully i will someday #deadlift #fitness #powerlifting #raw #rawpowerlifting #bodylab #fittnessworld #lifting #styrkeløft #dødløft #Nørrebro #Copenhagen #deathmetal #bodybuilding #københavn #squat #benchpress #jegløfter
