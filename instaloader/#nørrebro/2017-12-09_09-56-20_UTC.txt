Enjoy your weekend people. I’m off to work at the clinic @maven.og.mig - our last info meeting about rectus diastase this year. I will start my special training in January - hope you will follow a long- lots to learn, also for those who don’t have rectus diastase, but just want to train for better posture, flat belly and a healthy body (like myself). #quote #whitestrips #stomach #rectusdiastase #mavenogmig #clinic #nørrebro #followus #happybody #positivevibes #weekend #behindthescenes
