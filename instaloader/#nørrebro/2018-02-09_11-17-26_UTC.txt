Itâ€™s gonna be a HAZY FRIDAY, folks!!! Come get your beer geek on and try the excellent Terroir Series, where you can actually taste the differences of where a particular hop has been grown. Also we are releasing a IIPA flown straight in from San Diego. For the first time being released at the same time as in the US. Kitchen is open until 01 am and the bar until 02!!!
