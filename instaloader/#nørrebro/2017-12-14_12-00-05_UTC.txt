Hola #happygorditos! Are you ready for our next Special? It premieres today at 5 pm. Just like your abuela made it, we bring you “Pozole”. A spicy, meaty corn soup that’s perfect for these cold winter days! Remember to squeeze in the lime juice to break through some of that fat and heat! 65 Coronas!
