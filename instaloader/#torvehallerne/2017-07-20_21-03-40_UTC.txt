Lots of lovely fruits and veggies at Torvehallerne. On the right side of the stand you'll see a stack of rhubarbs, something I had never tried before. Thanks to my lovely brother in laws mother, I can now say that they are amazing in desserts, specifically if it's a rhubarb crumble with vanilla sauce 😍•
