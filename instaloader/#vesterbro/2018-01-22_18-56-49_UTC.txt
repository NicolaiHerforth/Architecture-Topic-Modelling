Uuh, mommy! The beauty of Isted, in Vesterbro CPH. Crunchiest, loudest pork crackling! You can feel the pop and crackle. No worry in the world with this slice of happiness. Place is just another #snägäri outside, but pure porkness inside. Ordered second one before the first was done. They have well cooked pork (#joulukinkku), cut a slice, fry it - and magic happens. Oozed red cabbage crowns the jewel. Isted Grill is the place to be, absolutely earns #jussisstampofapproval #meatmymaker #porkheaven #vesterbro #istedgrill #burgerist
