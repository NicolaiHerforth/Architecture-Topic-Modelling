Still looking for the perfect NYE beers? How about a 9% Belgian wild ale fermented with champagne yeast (Nelson Sauvignon) or aged on champagne barrels (Tenth Anniversary)?? Or if you'd rather Lambic, the Bzart series from Oud Beersel takes either straight #lambic , blended #geuze , or Oude #kriek and after bottling treats the bottles to the champagne method, where the yeast is disgorged from the bottle after 13 months. Expect high carbonation and an aging profile more similar to wine than lambic. Skål! 🥂🍾#newyearsbeers #2018 #nørrebro #københavn #mikkeller
