Roseborg castle! Day 3 of my trip. Currently live on @rriveterbags! Denmark was a great place to travel with a family and solo. Soon to come, tips on navigating Norwegian flights, packing for 10kg, and what are some cool things to bring back (and what you can find in the amazing CPH airport, tax free, without worrying about buying ahead of time!)
