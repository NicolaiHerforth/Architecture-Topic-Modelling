Bordello Bandits, Imperial India Pale Lager  6.4% Amager Bryghus Kastrup Denmark in collaboration with Ei8ght Ball Brewing Bellevue KY USA.

Enjoying some days of holiday at this moment.
My son got a whole week holiday and all schools are closed for the pre-spring holidays. Monika and i both took some holiday's to.
Got a bit of snow last night so Jari and i first went on a hike this morning in the snowy landscapes around our hometown.
Now sitting back, relaxing and writing a bit about last nights beer, one i shared with Monika.
Bordello Bandits is Amager's collab with Ei8ght Ball Brewing from Kentucky USA. A imperial strong lager. Indeed a strong and powerful and hoppy beer that can take the stand to a lot of ipa's.
It's creamy and hazy and full of flavor. 
Toasted bread, citrus and grapefruit where the main flavors i translated from it.
This is one powerful puppy..Lager? As said it's so hoppy that it easily can battle a lot of ipa's now a days.
Again quite a story about the Bordello Bandits crossing the Mexican borders and creating ravage etc in the Bordello's on the US side of the border. And that this issues might have been the first call for "the great wall"
Great wall or it.. it won't stop Amager from doing all the great collab's. They might even be Europe's most collaboration brewry.. don't know.. What i do know is that with this beer another great and succesful collab goes into their books!
4*
Cheers!
