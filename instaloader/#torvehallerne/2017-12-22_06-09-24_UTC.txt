Last week we had the privilege of exploring @torvehallernekbh food market in #conhenhagen which brings together a selection of stalls from fresh fish to gourmet chocolates. With the addition of a space dedicated to enjoying quick food to go. A great shopper experience in an inviting space flooded with natural light.
