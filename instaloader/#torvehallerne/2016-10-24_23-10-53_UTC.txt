Expect a short queue here even during non-peak hours. Got my hands on these pretty looking Smørrebrød (open faced sandwich) - pictures here is egg + shrimp + mayo-like sauce. Though the ingredients are fresh & tasty, I would prefer the bread to be warm instead of this slightly soggy & cold. #copenhagen #torvehallerne
