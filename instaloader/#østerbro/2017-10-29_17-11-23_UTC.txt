As Ingolf settles down let's just give you the lowdown on our machines: A Segway is a self balancing zero-emission transportation device that allows you to freely move around where ever you want to go. It’s super easy to ride – it uses a gyroscope to detect the movement of your body. Lean forward to drive, lean backwards to stop/slow down, and control the direction with the handlebar. It really is that simple! The Segway even slows you down if you are going too fast. It has a top speed of 20km/h and has a range of about 40km. You'll start your Segway Cruise Experience at our waterfront location on Langelinie Pier, where you'll receive individual instructions from your guide and get to practice on our spacious training ground until you feel comfortable to take off. Our guests are usually ready to go within minutes - It really is that easy! 😎 come try for yourself and Let's Cruise Copenhagen the Seg-way 💚🇩🇰🍃 #segwaycruise #letscruisecopenhagen #gåvækingolf #segway #segwaycopenhagen #segwaydenmark #segwaykøbenhavn #copenhagencruising #ibyen #aokdk #whattodoincopenhagen #1000thingstodoincopenhagen #tipkbh #funtoursincopenhagen #guidedtoursincopenhagen #guidedtours #langelinie #langelinealle #segwaycruisin #detgenmodificeredeparadis #bjørnnørgaard #voreskbh #greentours #grøntour #copenhagenguide #københavn #østerbro #copenhagen #visitcopenhagen #segwaytour
