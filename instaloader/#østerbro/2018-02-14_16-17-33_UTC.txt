Tried to get pastry from this place for 3 weeks already. It's either my schedule that prevents it, either their abnormal loooooooooooooooong cues in the weekend or this sign hanged on the door with hours to go until closing time.
I started making bets with friends wether we make it or not this spring:)) #junothebakery #pastries #danishpastries #Ã¸sterbro #picoftheday #copenhagenlife #croissants
