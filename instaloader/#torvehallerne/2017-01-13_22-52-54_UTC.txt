Last year I made a foodie  pilgrimmage to #copenhagen a place which has to be near the top of any foodies travel list. Copenhagen  of course is awash with #michelinstar restaurants and much like in the past when I got my picture taken at many a famous monument this  picture for me outside #noma was the equivalent of the  picture I had in Italy at the #trevifountain or the #spanishsteps at 21 and equally as  exciting, oh how my world  has changed. 😆🤐
Now I  don't have a Michelin star budget  so I  never got to dine at Noma  but I  didn't miss out because  Copenhagen has some fantastic  markets, #torvehallerne is a rival to the #englishmarketcork, there is the Disney land of food tourism experiences at @copenhagenstreetfood on #papiroen beside @nomacph and endless food experiences at the meat packing district.  With organic  food and  sourdough products everywhere. I  even had organic sourdough  pizza at #mothercopenhagen now that's what I'm talking about. I have  tonnes of footage, from which I'm fashioning a YouTube video but I am going to start instagramming some of the content so stay tuned and follow this feed If it is of interest to you.😆👍👍@copenhagenstreetfood #vistcopenhagen #tasteofireland #danishfood #denmark #irishblogger #irishfoodbloggers #irishfoodblogger @visitcopenhagen #copenhagen
