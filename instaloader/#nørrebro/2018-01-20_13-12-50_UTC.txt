Grød On You!

This #copenhagen based restaurant is turning the notion of #porridge being plain on its head by serving up delicious grains served in all kinds of ways. Using #organic, local and #seasonal ingredients are the base of their creations, and they have a dish to suit any mood; #Dahl, #Risotto, #Congee, #Granola and Breakfast #Chia #Oats are some menu options. 
Here is the “Barley-Otto”... Creamy + Comforting on a cold day, with Jerusalem Artichoke slices on top. 🥣
