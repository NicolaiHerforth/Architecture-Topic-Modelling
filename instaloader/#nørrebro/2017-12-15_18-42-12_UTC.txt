Danish design meets our raw unfinished Copenhagen Loft. TBT to our loft earlier this year, when we were doing some improvements with me goofing around with a broken ankle 😆😊! Those dark brown herringbone floors were the best decision ever ❤️! Everything is still crooked. But it's just how it should be, when you live in an about 160 year old building. Just imagine What this old building has outlived here in Copenhagen ... simply amazing❤️#livinginhistory #copenhagen #københavn #nørrebro #danishdesign #arnejacobsen
