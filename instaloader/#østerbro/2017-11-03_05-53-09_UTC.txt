Svanemøllen Busterminal. Østerbro’s only “Farmhouse”: House for the bus staff. It was moved 1908 from Østerbrogades Kaserne (Husarkasernen), near the stadion, where the former terminal was (see yesterday’s pic). And no, the house was never a real farmhouse. #Svanemøllen #Østerbro #danskerneshistorie #igersdenmark #theprettycities #københavn #copenhagen #aokdk #visitcopenhagen #igerscopenhagen #cphpicks #mitkbh #arkitektur #architecture #architecturelovers #canonphotography #nofilter #udenfilter  #citylife #loves_united_copenhagen #tipkbh #halftimbered
