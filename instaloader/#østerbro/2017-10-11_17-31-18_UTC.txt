Wednesday throwback whatever. From that time I finally took my boys with me to Copenhagen. #cphwiththeboys Just booked a trip, a business one, beginning next year. Looking for a new home away from home thru airbnb (my fave way of traveling with kids ;) so I can bring the squad, stay a little longer and mixing business with pleasure! #freelanceparents #oleoleolee #airbnb
