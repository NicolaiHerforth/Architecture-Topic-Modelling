❤️🎄December 4th🎄❤️
4th day of my positivity advent calendar. Would love it if you’d join in in the comments - see explanation below and previous posts 😊 This evening I’m having dinner with my fantastic colleagues and I’m sure it’ll be my positive experience of the day 😃 It’s gonna be an evening of hygge, good laughs and yummy food 😍😋
.
I’m “hosting” a little positivity advent calendar here on Instagram 😃 Every day until Christmas, I’ll post a photo (in the afternoon/evening CET) and in the caption I’ll share something positive from my day. And I hope that some of you guys would join me by leaving a comment about something positive from YOUR day? 😊 It could be anything. Something that made you smile or laugh, something you're grateful for, something or someone that made your day - you name it. It’s all about collecting good thoughts and experiences, and by sharing them with each other, I’m sure we’ll get into the Christmas spirit 🎄❤️✨ What do you say? 😊
