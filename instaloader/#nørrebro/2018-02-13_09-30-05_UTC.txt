Some thoughts on ingredients and expectations 🍞🍰🍩Any newcomer to the Naturally Gluten-free world of baking is taken by all the new flavors, textures, looks and and the delicacy with how to treat ingredients, kneading, proofing and baking time - it's alchemy! No wonder some people find it difficult. At a normal bakery you often pour from 1 flour bag. At a gluten-free bakery you pour from at least 3-4 bags to get the right balance between fibers and starch. At Feelgood Bakery we strive to make it easy for those who are gluten-free - and often dairy-free as well. These cookies are made with a Feelgood Bakery mix. Today we made them with dairy-free and sugar reduced ingredients. The result is amazing (though of course different than those with butter and wheat)! ↪️Just note, as always when substituting butter with dairy-free products to put less in than recipe requires - the fatty acid structure spreads out faster when baked ↩️ #happybaking #chocolatechipcookie #coconutsugar #dairyfree #ingredientexpectation #alchemy #glutenfree #glutenfri #wheatfree #copenhagen #feelgoodbakery #microbakery #denmark #københavn #nørrebro #cookie #webbakery #nordicglutenfree #mælkefri
