There are so many reformer exercises that have helped me and my clients find new possibilities for body and find mobility...and very often for dancers as they are flexible the strength is gone in extremities as the control is practiced in framed and restricted ranges...but how to use full range and find control also in full mobility...ðŸ˜Š I teach reformer/Cadillac/Mat/mobility/release/activation  classes at ROH Studio every day...if you are interested in a session write to me or send a text on 52527414.  #reformerpilates #matclasses #pilates #bodycontrolpilates #release #activation #fullmobility #flexibility #approvemobility #fullrange #mindbodyapp #Ã¸sterbro #pilates #trainingsession #dancecrosstraining
