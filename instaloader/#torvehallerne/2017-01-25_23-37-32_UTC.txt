One of the must try things in Copenhagen  are the hot dogs from the "traditional "  #streetfood vendors. The first  one in the video was at Nyhavn, the second  in the middle of the city  and the third was an example of the more modern #copenhagen food scene it was at #torvehallerne market and was using organic meat served with a herb sauce. All 3 were delicious in their own and different ways. And the trucks are found all over the city. #copenhagenstreetfood #tasteofireland #copenhagenfood #vistcopenhagen #foodtourist #travel #hotdog üç¥ #food #foodporn #foodie  #instafood #yummy #sharefood #instaeat #foodstagram #sweet #yummyfood #foodlovers #amazingfood #foodforlife #tasty #foodpictures #foodlover  #foodie #irishfoodblogger #irishblogger @royalcaribbeanuk #kobenhaven #hygge
