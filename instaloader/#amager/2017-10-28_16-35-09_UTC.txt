📸: Jesper Skovbølle. Today I helped out at a race at my club Amager Cyklering. Even though I had put on a LOT of clothes it was still cold as f . . . ! ❄️ But what a nice day it was. And we really have extremely fast young riders in our club. Yay🙅🏻 Today's program: commute - commute - 🏁 - strength training ---> 🍷#acr#amagercyklering#copenhagen#amager#racing#volunteeringisfun#grazie#sockdoping#autumn#cycling#cyclingshots#cyclist#girlswhoride#girlswhoridebikes#orangeisthenewblack#coldday#quality#fromwhereiride#lifebehindbars#outsideisfree#outsideiscold
