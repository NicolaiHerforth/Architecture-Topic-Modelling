So, one of my foodie dreams has come true: a Swedish bakery in my beloved Copenhagen, how awesome is that!
.
@juno_the_bakery opened up a couple of months ago and, ever since, has had the Danes standing in line to pick up their freshly baked treats on a daily basis
.
Located in the district of Østerbro, the small bakery is producing an insane variety of mouth-watering Swedish classics such as the iconic -and personal favorite- cardamom bun and the almost surreal -such a biased appreciation, I know- semla, a cardamom-y bun filled with sugary almond paste, whipped cream and topped off with powdered sugar.
Here, their version is with chopped toasted almonds, which provides an interesting textural contrast.
Veredict: 😍🤤!!!
No words needed, go visit them and get ready to try some of the best pastries and breads in your life.
Wish ya’ll a sweet Friday 🙋🏽‍♂️💜
