So this just happend. My first ever analog shot. This one is shot on an old Yashica MF2, thats probably way older than myself. Shot on Kodak Gold, and converted to BW. I decided to try this after watching a guy called @pawfriis on his channel @noisefilm.co, talking about how to get started with analogue film. So thanks to Paw for sharing that.
