Last night was Culture Night in Copenhagen. One evening every year, where the public gets to go pretty much everwhere behind the scenes: the hospital, TV, the fire house, the police department, all kinds of artistic matters, you name it. And so we did, one of my best friends and I. It was great! We drank "blood" and went to night church and we had the best waffles in the city by the canals😝
