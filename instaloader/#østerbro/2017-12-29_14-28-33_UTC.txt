Here are my top 9 pictures of 2017. There is a little bit of everything: the big day when I became Danish citizen and received my new passport, traveling to the new destinations, 3 Danish cities that have a special place in my heart and the last NY‚Äôs celebration.ü•ÇThis year has been great and challenging in many ways. It was busy and full of new adventures, lots of work, exciting destinations, meetings with old friends and new interesting people. It has given me so much positive emotions and happiness.üíï There were also other less glamours happenings and concerns, but they are not worth focusing on. So I would like to say that I am incredibly thankful for the year that passed and can‚Äôt wait for 2018, full of dreams and new plans.‚ú® Did you have a good year? I usually do a resum√® of 10 bullet points with plans/goals for the next year and summarizing 10 points from the previous year. It gives a good idea of the progress made during a year. This might be too personal for Instagram, but my written diary can handle it.üòâ Do you track your plans during the year?
