Into the night!
They ventured into the night
Searching for the hour of light
Lost souls
Clinging to the hope
Of another chance
Stripped
Bare
Abandoned
They ran into the night
Searching for the hour of light
Never the same
Different somehow
Chasing demons
In search of innocence
Shadows fell hard
They ran into the night
Wishing to forget
Hoping to be different 
But never to be the same again
They ventured into the night
And never looked back
