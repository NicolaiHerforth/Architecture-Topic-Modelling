Asked #wide yesterday evening by lovely and creative @gillian_talesfromahappyhouse #thanks 😊
We were settling in at home after a great week in Copenhagen.  I'll spare you the mountains of laundry or the tired kids with each their screen 😉 So here's a shot of some of the typical old and charming houses in the center of Copenhagen 🏡 We have a lot of friends and family there and never tire of visiting the capital once again. 
What's #widn for you ladies @todaysstuff_leanne @karinhrkilde and @59astrid?
