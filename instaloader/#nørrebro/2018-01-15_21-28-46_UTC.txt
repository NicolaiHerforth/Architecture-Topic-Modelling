Copenhagen Food Crawl:

Authentic mexican food is luckily not an impossible task to find in Copenhagen, anymore.
One of those places that does mexican right, is Blue Taco in the colorful Nørrebro neighbourhood of Copenhagen.
Their claim to fame, are the blue corn tortillas, that are more than just a gimmick. They’re apparently healthier, and pretty tasty aswell. 
I was personally thrilled at the many taco options they had, although it was a difficult choice. 
In the end I opted for a deep fried shrimp taco, a Coca Cola beef, and a vegan one with pozole (a form of fermented dry corn) and cactus.
All three were very flavourful, but the beef one was my favorite. I - of course - had to wash it down with a mexican soda, a sugar loaded Jarritos Pineapple. They’re too sweet for my liking, but they’re somehow a perfect fit with messy tacos.

I can’t wait to come back an give the rest of the menu a try. Did I mention they even have fried grasshoppers! If that’s not authentic mexican, then just call me a stupid gringo.
