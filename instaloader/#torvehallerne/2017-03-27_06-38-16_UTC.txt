We fly back to Australia today after two glorious months in Europe. Sad to be leaving but also feeling so lucky because I got to experience it all with my favourite person. This guy went to every art museum imaginable with me, made me cups of tea literally every morning and took care of me when I was sick. Thank you for being the sweetest Bae, I can't wait for our next big adventure ☕️❤️🥐 #Copenhagen #torvehallerne #coffee
