This old building used to be a bath house (badeanstalten) and was build because people in Copenhagen didn't have shower and toilet facilities in their own appartments. It was placed here because it was very close to the first water work in Copenhagen. Today it's a hotel called Ascot. Right across the street is another old building called Pumpehuset, which means "the pump house". Originally the building was a part of the old water work - today it's a concert venue. #ihavethisthingwithbricks #delditkbh #bricks #bathhouse #1902 #mursten #indreby #studiestr√¶de #pumpehuset #badeanstalten #ascothotelcopenhagen
