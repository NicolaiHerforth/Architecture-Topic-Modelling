#copenhagen is a #food capital indeed! Have been eating some of best #streetfood from around the world. Highly recommend the Hija de Sanchez in the #Torvehallerne marketplace. It has the best #tacos in Europe. The #paperisland streetfoodmarket is amazing. Tried the #potatocrisppizza total delish. Oh and do try the #yum #yasaiudon at #wakamama and bhel puri at Mumbai restaurant. And the yummiest #smoothies and #Sandwiches at #joeandjuice
