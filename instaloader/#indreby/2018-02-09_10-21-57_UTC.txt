Have you ever been in Calabria? 🔹Historical Sites 🔹
Explore Calabria's history with a visit to one of the local UNESCO-designated World Heritage Sites. The Cattolica Monastery in Stilo dates from around the 10th century and is a testament to Stilo's past links to Greece and the Ottoman Empire in the eastern Mediterranean. The tiny red-brick church is built into the mountainside, following a Greek cross layout, and bears many similarities to structures found in Armenia and parts of Greece. Other Byzantine-era religious sites survive in Calabria at Santa Maria del Pathirion in Rossano and San Giovanni Teresti in Bivongi. 🔹Beaches🔹
Most Calabrian visitors head for the coast to enjoy the region's hot summer weather. Regional capital Reggio di Calabria basks in an average of 88 degrees F in August, its hottest, and also busiest, month. The pretty coastal town of Tropea makes a good base for sunseekers with its extensive sandy beaches and views out over the Tyrrhenian Sea as far as Mount Stromboli on a clear day. Nearby, the Capo Vaticano beaches of Grotticelle and Tonicello are large enough to find your own space even during the peak season. 🔹Outdoors Activities🔹
Tourists focus mainly on Calabria's coastline so much of its interior remains relatively undeveloped; agriculture provides the primary source of income in the region. Visit a working farm like Le Pisarre near Cosenza to see fields of citrus and olive trees, and to buy organic fruit, vegetables and honey. To further explore Calabria's landscape, visit the Parco Nazionale Della Sila (parcosila.it/web/en), which takes in areas of Mediterranean scrub land along with pine and beech forests. Hike to the park in spring to see beautiful wildflowers in full bloom, including violi, narcissi and hyacinth alongside edible plants like thyme, oregano and mint. Stay tuned for the next post 🇮🇹😋😍
