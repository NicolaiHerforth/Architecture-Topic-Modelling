So I got this really great idea to go for a walk. Weather was quite alright despite it being -1°c. But at least it wasn't raining. 
It was a nice long walk, and I felt like walking further, but then SOMEONE thought it was an awesome idea to start snowing, so I went home. 😏 
I did manage to walk 6,77km though. And no, I am not a big fan of the cold or the snow. 
I am however amazed by the silence there is at the cemetery. There are big roads surrounding it and a trainstation, but it's still so quiet #weekend #lørdag #saturday #walk #gåtur #vestrekirkegård #vestrecemetery #cemetery #kirkegård #februar #february #sne #snow #me #selfie #kirstine #kirstinemedK #silence #stilhed #copenhagen #københavn #valby
