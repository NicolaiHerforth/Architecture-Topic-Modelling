❤️🎄December 7th🎄❤️
7th day of my little positivity advent calendar. Would love it if you’d join in in the comments - see explanation below and previous posts 😊 THANK YOU to all of you, who’ve joined in so far! I love reading your comments and I really appreciate you sharing your positive experiences with me/us ☺️🙏❤️ Today I’ve had a slow and quiet day, which is nice, as the upcoming weekend is packed. But it’s packed with lots of Christmas hygge with good people, and I’m looking so much forward to it all 😊🎄
.
I’m “hosting” a little positivity advent calendar here on Instagram 😃 Every day until Christmas, I’ll post a photo (in the afternoon/evening CET) and in the caption I’ll share something positive from my day. And I hope that some of you guys would join me by leaving a comment about something positive from YOUR day? 😊 It could be anything. Something that made you smile or laugh, something you're grateful for, something or someone that made your day - you name it. It’s all about collecting good thoughts and experiences, and by sharing them with each other, I’m sure we’ll get into the Christmas spirit 🎄❤️✨ What do you say? 😊
