My New Year’s resolution: instead of just talking about trying out other ways of ‘buying’ clothes and being more sustainable, I am now a member of @theorganicclub_vesterbro. I handed in all my used clothes that I didn’t use enough to the store, and I got 1600 points. That should be enough for the next couple of months I would say. The good thing about @theorganicclub is that they have several stores around Denmark and you can use your points in all stores. What about you, how will you make your 2018 more sustainable? ♻️✌🏼 all the best from @stinekolding #mysustainablewardrobe2.0
