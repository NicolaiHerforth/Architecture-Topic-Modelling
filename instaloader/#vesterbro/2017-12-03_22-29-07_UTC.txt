Denmark - Christiania #denmark #kÃ¸benhavn
This building was inside the community neighbourhood of christiania in Copenhagen. If you plan on visiting Denmark during the winter, get sure to get prepared and get some real winter clothes. I checked the meteo before leaving and the temperatures seemed really alright, a few degres and I thought it would be a piece of cake but the temperature you feel with the wind and staying all day outside is COLD. Otherwise it was really awesome to walk around the city ðŸ˜Š
