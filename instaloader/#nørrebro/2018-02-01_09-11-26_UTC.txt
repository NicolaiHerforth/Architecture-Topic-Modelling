Carbon paste is usually used to make handlebars and seatposts stay where they're supposed to. But as you can see in the next photos it's also a great remover of sufface rust on chrome. Take a little bit on a rag and rub it on the rust and see it disappear. If there's a lot of rust you might have take the top of with a blunt edge, like the side of an allen key or screwdriver. Of course there is products on the market specific for this problem but they all smell like a chemical factory. The carbon paste from @juicelubes is pretty much odorless. .
