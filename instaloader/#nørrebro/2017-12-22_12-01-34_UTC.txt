In winter, we find that the best cure for the doom and gloom is hazy New England style beers. We have two fresh ones for you: a fresh batch of our favorite IPA The BRUS Brothers and the brand new NEed Wheat, a tropical, hazy wheat beer. Bar is open until 3 tonight and classic soul records spinning from 21:00 tonight so come by and cure your pre-ðŸŽ„ jitters with us.
