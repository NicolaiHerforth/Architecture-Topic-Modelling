@larryvsharry celebrated their 10th birthday yesterday. It's been amazing to see how they have taken the world of cargo bikes by storm. Their Bullit bike is a modern take on the classic Long John, and one of the most versatile cargo bikes on the market. It can be everything from laidback baby/kid transportation device, to full on messenger racing beast. Happy birthday guys!
