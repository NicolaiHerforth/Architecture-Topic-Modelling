This is DAY 3 of Freedom Music Festival vol. 3 , a MOVIE NIGHT at Husets Biograf and a BONUS
•••
at 19:00 “The Breath Courses Through Us” by Alan Roth is a documentary about the early 1960s avant-garde jazz group, the New York Art Quartet. The film focuses on the group’s 35-year reunion, while reaching back through recollections of their foundations and innovative musical ideas. The film emulates the group’s style of music and challenges to let go of the expectations of documentaries we might have, much like free jazz subverts the traditional structure of jazz. •••
at 21:00 “Rising Tones Cross” by Ebba Jahn will take you in time to NYC of the 80s, a rough-and-tumble place filled with a wonderful array of musicians in a state of hyper-creativity. The film features players like Charles Gayle, William Parker, John Zorn, Jemeel Moondoc, Irene Schweizer or Peter Brötzmann. •••
BONUS: 8:20 PM : Tomo Jacobson + Rasmus Kjærgård Lund 'Solo no. 7' & 'Solo no. 8' release party! A short yet condensed release party, with two solo concerts by Tomo and Rasmus who embarked on a journey to release one solo each month of 2017. Impressive enough.
See you in Husets Biograf.
