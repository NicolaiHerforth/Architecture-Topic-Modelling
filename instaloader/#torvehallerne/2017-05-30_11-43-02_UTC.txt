Am in the capital, Copenhagen, for a couple of seminars. Whenever I am here, and I get the chance, I visit Torvehallerne (a pair of lavish twin food halls). Luckily, today, I have a couple of hours in between seminars. After lunch (I did have lunch, I promise ğŸ™ˆğŸ˜¬) I am having Granny's House's famous Lemon Merengue Pie. It really is all that!!
