Mund de Carlo - Hovedet PÃ¥ Blokken 
I've been given the opportunity to sneak-peak this album. Since I started listening to it a week ago, I haven't heard anything else... It's touching to hear an album paint such a thorough picture of NÃ¸rrebro - the city I love and live in. It is tied beautifully together and provides a full experience of the ups and downs in our wonderful town. Every track says so much and it is obvious how meaningful each song is for the experience of the album as a whole. As you know, I have known Carlos for a long time and been a fan of his for even longer, but I have never heard him be so honest, personal and political in his music, which suits him. 
The album will be released in March and can already be pre-ordered now at @runforcover.dk !! Ladies and gentlemen - I know it's early, but this could very well be the best album of the year!! A huge s/o to @munddecarlo and @miladgenius for creating this masterpiece of an album!ðŸ”¥ ___________________________________
