Cheese of this week: Stilton. Coming from the finest farms of England, this blue cheese might seem a bit dry and crumbly at first, but wait till it meets your tongue: it will melt and an explosion of powerful flavours will gather in your mouth. Creamy and highly tasteful, this cheese is known as “The King of English Cheeses” and is especially eaten during the Christmas period. What a better time to come and taste it now?
