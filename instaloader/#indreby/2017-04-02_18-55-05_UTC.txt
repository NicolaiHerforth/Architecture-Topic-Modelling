ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡°Spring in Copenhagen! ğŸŒ·Indre By (lit. English, "Inner City"), also known as Copenhagen Center or K or Downtown Copenhagen, is an administrative district (by) in central Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark. This district is the historic, geographic and political heart of present-day Copenhagen, and reflects the history of Denmark. Its boundaries pretty much reflect the entire cityâ€™s extent during the reign of King Christian IV (1588-1648). ğŸ‘‘#springincopenhagen #indreby #storeregnegade #storeregnegade19 #jazzhusmontmartre #copenhagen #kÃ¸benhavn #kÃ¶penhamn #kopenhagen #denmark #danmark #dÃ¤nemark #scandinavianlifestyle #scandinavia #visitdenmark #opdagdanmark #voreskbh #kbh
