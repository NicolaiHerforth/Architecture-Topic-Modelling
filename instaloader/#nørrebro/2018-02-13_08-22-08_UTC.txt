Yesterday I had the pleasure of tattooing the amazing young badass of a woman that is Zoe. She’s all the way from down under and has been traveling Europe by herself for the past 8 months. We went for a walk and spend a few hours together after the session. Thanks for sharing some of your stories with me - amazed that you can be symbiotic with someone you’ve never met and who’s born and raised on the other side of the planet. Now my lines are going to walk around in Australia - that’s pretty fucking cool too.
