#Happy 1st Day of #Winter ~ #tbt 2010 in #Amager #Denmark, an area just outside of #Copenhagen where I used to take #walks. I remember this day clearly. I woke up after a big #snow storm, saw all the snow, grabbed my camera and went out to shoot. It was freezing cold so I put on my winter gear and ventured out. I was one of only a few people out in this nature area enjoying the freshly-fallen snow. I remember it was dead silent like walking in a cocoon â€” a true magical winter wonderland. #christmasiscoming #scandinavia #denmarkmemories #mysecondhome #nature
