Copenhagen Food Crawl:
Is this the best sandwich in Copenhagen? It’s certainly a worthy candicate.
The Confit de canard (or pulled duck/confit duck) sandwich at Ma Poule in Torvehallerne has been making waves, ever since they opened. It’s famed - and for good reason. Simply prepared with lovely duck meat, some mustard and arugula in a french baguette. Nothing more needed.
