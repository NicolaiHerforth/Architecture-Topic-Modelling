July evening at MÃ¸llerens Oase. Wishing for more space next year. It's been fun so far, but also a puzzle on how to grow so many sorts on a tiny spot. Step by step process. Slowly adding more pots and beds around the yard, filling out empty spots, seeding backup plants and alot of companion planting to utilize every inch of open ground. ðŸ’š
