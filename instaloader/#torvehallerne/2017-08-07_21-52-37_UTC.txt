So, what else have I enjoyed in moody #copenhagen : 🏣 the pretty #buildings (marveling at intricate #façades makes me inexplicably happy, I guess I'm really enjoying every little detail in my new relaxed, travel-focused life 🎒☀️)
.
🐟🥗 the food at wonderful #torvehallernemarket. There are just so many cute shops, restaurants, bistros, chocolate shops, etc. Plus handmade soaps, creams, perfumes! 🌸 secret tip: go to #grød for a super hearty, rich and healthy breakfast or lunch. Or both! 😍
.
☀️ the Sun, those few moments that I caught it saying hi to me in Copenhagen. It just made everything so much more colorful and pretty ✨
.
And this concludes my short but color-filled trip to pretty Copenhagen. I must say traveling is just so much better than fighting 😂
I'm handing over now to my lovely Sis Mercury 💛
