Classic Christmas setup with the pink Nisse chairs from Ikea and my granddads door, witch he painted when he helped us renovate the house. I came home one day and he said “a cat jumped through the window and it made me wanna paint the door” and I have loved it ever since. #christmas #painting #familytime #home #amager #artist
