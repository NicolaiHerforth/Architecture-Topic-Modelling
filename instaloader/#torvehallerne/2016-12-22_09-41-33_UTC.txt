London's gone taco crazy with Breddos, El Pastor & Temper all dishing them out this month. But you might want to hop on a plane to #kÃ¸benhavn for a tasty trio from @hijadesanchez in #vesterbro / #torvehallerne. We loved this colourful spot near our flat, and devoured some pork & pineapple (al pastor), egg, and squash tacos with a decent kick after a heavy night. ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡°ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡°ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡°
