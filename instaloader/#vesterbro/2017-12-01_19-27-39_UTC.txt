Dave & his Instagram Doppelgänger, Meeno! It’s quite a serendipitous story, actually 🤘- 3 years ago, Dave came across Meeno’s page while scrolling through Instagram - and he posted a picture of them both, with the capture; ‘I found my instagram doppelgänger!’. 2 years later, Dave and I are in Copenhagen central train station, after just landing for a summer visit, and there we randomly stumble into Meeno and his wonderful family! (..What the hell are the chances of that?!!!!!)...We ended up going to a wine bar together that same night, and had such a fun time eating and drinking for hours. And now, 1 1/2 years after that - we just stayed at their beautiful Yurt @skyfarmyurt at the end of our 2 week California road trip!! @meenophoto & @ilseackermann are the most awesome souls, and we are so happy to call them friends ❤️ #doppelgänger #doppelganger #jewfro #skyfarmyurt #losangeles #california #roadtrip #friends #life #adventure #smallworld #nothingisordinary #nocoincidence #lifeisbeautiful #serendipity #vinhanen #Vesterbro #copenhagen @dbeame
