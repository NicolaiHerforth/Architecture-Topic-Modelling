If you are visiting Ireland and if good food is a priority then you need to start your trip at the #englishmarketcork where you will instantly be introduced to #Irishcheese , fresh #irishoysters and produce like #frankhederman #smokedsalmon similarly when I visited  #copenhagen the first place I visited was the magnificent  #torvehallerne @torvehallernekbh  #market which houses the best if #danishfood from cheeses to fine apples liqueurs, fish, #organicmeats , proper #danishpastries #smorrebrod #schnaps as well as a fantastic  #sushi bar #tapas bar , Danish #porridgebar #mikkeller #craftbeer  and on and on. It's foodie paradise.  Book off the whole day to go there  a must visit for a trip to Copenhagen. I'm continuing to post short 1 minute vids from my Copenhagen adventure. Stay tuned for more and see the previous posts for more on the city. 👍👍👍💚
