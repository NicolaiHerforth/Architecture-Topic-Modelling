Østerfælled Torv. Entrance to former Gardehusarkasernen (1896-98). It was used by the hussars until 1939, and renamed  Østerbrogades Kaserne. Architect Eugen Jørgensen. In 1993 it was bought by Børne- og Ungdomspædagogernes Landsorganisation, BUPL, and transformed to shops, apartments, cultural institutions like the theatres Kanonhallen, Krudttønden and Dansescenen, cafe etc. The buildings on both sides of the gates were used for guards and prison. The gaslights are original. The gate is high, so riders with a banner could get through. #østerfælledtorv #Østerbro #danskerneshistorie #igersdenmark #theprettycities #københavn #copenhagen #aokdk #visitcopenhagen #igerscopenhagen #cphpicks #mitkbh #arkitektur #architecture #architecturelovers #canonphotography #nofilter #udenfilter  #citylife #loves_united_copenhagen #tipkbh #EugenJørgensen
