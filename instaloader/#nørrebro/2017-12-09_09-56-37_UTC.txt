Every Saturday and Sunday leading up to Christmas, you can get your very own pesticide-free and well-nourished Christmas tree from the square outside BRUS from 12:00-16:00! The Nordmann trees are from a sustainable farm straight outta Djursland. 
Weâ€™ll be serving glÃ¸gg, hot toddies, warm spiced apple juice, hot chocolate and irish coffee in the BRUS shop to keep you warm and happy ðŸŽ„
