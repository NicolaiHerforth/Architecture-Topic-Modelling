2017 was crazy! The store moved to Bragesgade and that was a big game changer! Many new customers because of the nice location and its a dope spot to do hangouts and record releases. Shoutout to @shatter_hands who told me it was available. Looking forward to do more events next year!

In 2018 I will start Rekords Records, a record label that will focus on Danish Hip Hop and Beats - the first handfull of releases are already planned. I'm super excited for this!

People been asking if I will be able to keep getting my hands on those dope second hand hiphop collections - and it seems so! I already have the first few collections planned for early 2018. So dont worry! Much more dope and rare hip hop vinyl on the way!

Thanks to everyone supporting! Lets make 2018 even more crazy!
Happy new year ! Peace !
