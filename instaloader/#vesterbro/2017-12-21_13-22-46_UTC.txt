Last day of Christmas! Or at least for us. This is the choice of @patrickhult and he always goes big. Magnum austrian red to go with the pork, super tasty red burgundy for the duck and a inbetween wine - a fun take on auxerrois from Alsace  #ancestralebar #christmaswines #lastdayofservice #yay #vinvivant #getyourwineon #vesterbro #winebar #wineshop
