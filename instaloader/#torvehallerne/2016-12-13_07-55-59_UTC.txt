My favourite place in the city has to be the Torvehallerne; a buzzing food market set within two glass houses. One half houses the rawer of ingredients; fresh fish on ice, local meats and cold cuts, bread, cheese and there is a nut stall I am rather fond of which does spectacular things like chocolate coated pecans and walnuts. Over in the other glass house sit the cafes and lunch-time places; there is a popular porridge spot in the corner, a very good coffee stall, about three places that serve glugg (mulled wine but richer in Nordic spice), half a dozen vibrant sandwich and salad stalls and a constantly busy fish cake stand offering wooden spoons of the delicious stuff dipped in fresh tartar sauce. After sampling one of everything we settled on two boxes of the brightest salads made with locally sourced ingredients, a whole smoked mackerel and two thick slices of nutty rye.
