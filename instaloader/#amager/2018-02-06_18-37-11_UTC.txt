Mixed weather in CPH today ☀️❄️
I’ve been a little quiet here on Instagram lately. Just having some introverted days, which I tend to need when thoughts are many and new ideas and important realizations are surfacing. I wouldn’t call myself an introvert though, but I’ve always been quite the thinker, so a good balance between alone time and social time is important to me. Do you guys also have introverted days sometimes? 😊🤔
