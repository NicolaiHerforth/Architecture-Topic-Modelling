I went grocery shopping with Musse. Dropped a bag of rye bread and she picked it up and walked 3 meters in front of me, proudly the whole time till we got home. She didn't drop it until we made it all the way up to the apartment and my boyfriend saw, what a good girl she was.. 😸From all the extra weight I'm carrying at the moment, this was a very nice gesture 🐕🐕😅♥️#dog #goldenlab #labrador #goodgirl #bread #helpingdog #love #prouddog #denmark #amager
