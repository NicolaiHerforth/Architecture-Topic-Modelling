One of those days... lost a shoe not once but twice in the mud! I felt kind of dumb as I stood there trying to get other runners to not step on it... At home I realize Iâ€™ve been running with a wrong bib - hope the organizers @trailmandk are up for a little adjustment to the result list later. All in all a thoroughly enjoyable day #cphcoasthalf #halfmarathon #mudallover #remembertotightenyourshoes #alwaysarunner #sundayfunday #sundayrunday #sundayfundayrunday #trailman #amager #kviktriteam
