Yesterday I walked in to Torvehallerne (delicious food market in cph) and the first thing I saw was this sweet fella sitting on its own chair, enjoying a cup of water and overall looking adorable with the owner. I really enjoy connecting with the dog owners and their dogs. Makes my day every time! Especially cause my dachshund is so far away.
