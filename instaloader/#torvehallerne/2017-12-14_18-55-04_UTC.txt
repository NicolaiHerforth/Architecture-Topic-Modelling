Cheese of the week: Beaufort. Firm yet creamy, fruity and rich. The Beaufort we have in store at Ma Poule is the summer Beaufort “Chalet d’Alpage” meaning that it comes from small flocks of cows located at more than an altitude of 1100 meters. Therefore, it is of good quality and one could almost say it’s organic. Care to try it?
