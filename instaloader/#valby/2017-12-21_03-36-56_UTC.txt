Trekroner Bryggeri. The factory was established 1899, and was meant to house the brewery from 1899, designed by Caspar Leuning Borch. Only one third of the brewery is left. A war broke out between Carlsberg and De forenede Bryggerier, the latter swallowing up the brewery even before it moved in. The last beer left the factory in 1915, and was used by the tannery Ballin & Hertz. The building was modyfied for that purpose 1919-20 by architect Niels Hauberg. 30 years ago it was meant to be torn down, but luckily saved by unions and now used by the childrens’ organization Børns Vilkår. #Valby #CasparLeuningBorch #NielsHauberg #TrekronerBryggeri #brewery #arkitektur #architecture #architecturelovers #bygningskultur #bygningshistorie #danskerneshistorie #københavn #copenhagen #aokdk #visitcopenhagen #igerscopenhagen #cphpicks #mitkbh #canonphotography #nofilter #udenfilter #archi_focus_on  #LifeofDenmark
