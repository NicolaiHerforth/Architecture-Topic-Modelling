Me and my friend went for lunch at a place called "Torvehallerne". It's basically 80 shops in one market place! My friend got a pizza from a place called "Gorm's", where they make Italian pizzas üçï! I got a gluten free panini sandwich with chicken, avocado and pesto. The place is called "VitaBoost"
