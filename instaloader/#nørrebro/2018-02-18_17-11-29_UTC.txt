"Where do you want to go when here?" "Superkilen!!" "... OK." Thanks @kasper_ly for capturing my absurd happiness when visiting this public park in theÂ NÃ¸rrebroÂ district ofÂ Copenhagen. Designed by the arts groupÂ SuperflexÂ with the collaboration ofÂ Bjarke Ingels GroupÂ andÂ Topotek1, a GermanÂ landscape architectureÂ firm, the park was officially opened in June 2012. I've been wanting to see it since 2016 when I attended a conference on urban development in Hong Kong and this was used as an example of regenerative projects intended to celebrate diversity. Filled with objects from around the globe, it is designed as a kind of world exposition for the local inhabitants, covering over 60 nationalities, who have been able to contribute their own ideas and artefacts to the project. ğŸ’› @superflexstudio @big_builds @topotek1 #superkilen #art #architecture #urbandevelopment #community #diversity #nÃ¸rrebro #copenhagen #superflex #BIG #bjarkeingelsgroup #topotek1
