On Copenhagen: Torvehallerne

A glorious foodhall.  Fresh and dried produce, seafood, cooked food, jars of condiments, teas, coffees, pastries, chocolates (the ubiquitous Summerbird) and even handcrafted soaps abound. 
The stalls outside mostly sold fresh fruits and vegetables which offered a riot of colours. Good place to spend a few hours..
