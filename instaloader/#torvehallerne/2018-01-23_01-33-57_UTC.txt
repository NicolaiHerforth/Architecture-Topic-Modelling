Mikkeller IPA brewed by De Proefbrouwerij. Copenhagen, Denmark.

So I'm back with my beers in this year. It has been a while... first Christmas and after laziness stoped me for posting new reviews but I will make it up! I have couple of beers still from trip to Copenhagen.
 First is the Mikkeller which I have visit in @torvehallernekbh . 
Beer is medium caramel with some light head. Hazy amber and citrus aroma. Hoppy enough and grate balance with bitterness. Very nice and good start of the day.

Taste 8/10
Aroma 7.5/10
Price 30 dkk (3.5 euro)
Bottle 0.5 L
Alcohol 6.9 %
