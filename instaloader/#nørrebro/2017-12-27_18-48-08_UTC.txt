Popping bubbles is a NYE Tradition, but who says it has to be made from grapes 🍇?? Oude G(u)euze is a beer style that exhibits high carbonation, crisp acidity, minerality, stone fruits, and yeast flavours from bottle conditioning and aging "sur lie," everything you would find in the best champagne, for a fraction of the price! We have plenty of producers and bottles to choose from, we're open normal hours until the 31st when we close at 6pm. Don't be a chump, bring #geuze to the party and #getfamous 🥂🍾 #nørrebro #mikkeller #lambic #københavn
