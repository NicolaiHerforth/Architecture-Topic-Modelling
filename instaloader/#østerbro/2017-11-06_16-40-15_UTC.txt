Took a late afternoon walk in Faelledparken, Copenhagen today. Its very close to m'y apartment. How lucky am I!? This is just a few of the pics snapped today. I love my city, and fall is just gorgeous! Not a bad way to spend my monday. #fall #colours #beautiful #copenhagen #cityparks #mycity #goingforawalk #copenhagenlife #natureinthecity #københavn #fælledparken #photo #bevarvoresnatur #gottaloveit #walk #østerbro #sunshine #forgetthestressforawhile #luckyme #naturibyen #mitkbh #voreskbh #opdagdanmark #wonderlustcopenhagen
