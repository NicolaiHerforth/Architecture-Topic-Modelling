Valby Skole. I previously posted Valby Skole, daytime in October. This is how it looks nighttime. It’s holiday for the students, but about this time a day, some of them normally get to school, poor kids. The architect was Hans Peter Jacobsen (1877-1943). The industrial buildings were made for Porcelænsfabrikken Norden (now Royal Copenhagen). The factory produced high resistant porcelain, able to resist 2 million Volt. When it closed in the 1980s, the school moved in. #earlymorning #tidligmorgen #ValbySkole #Valby #Porcelænsfabrikken #HansPeterJacobsen #arkitektur #architecture #architecturelovers #danskerneshistorie #københavn #copenhagen #aokdk #visitcopenhagen #igerscopenhagen #cphpicks #mitkbh  #nofilter #udenfilter #loves_united_copenhagen #tipkbh
