1 day ‘til opening night!! Like all good fairytales, Sleeping Beauty features “good guys” and “bad guys.” On team good we have Fairy Peaceful and Fairy Graceful, Aurora’s lovely fairy godmothers. On team bad we have Carabosse (dun dun DUN), the most evil fairy in all the land, and Spindleshanks, her partner in crime (who just so happens to be a cat!) If you want to see these two teams face off, you’d better reserve your tickets now at ctcircle.dk/buy-tickets #ctcsleeping 😇😇 / 👿😼
