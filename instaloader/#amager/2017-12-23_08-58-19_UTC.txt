KALVEBOD FÆLLED SKOLE. Kalvebod Fælled School is placed on the border of the Arena area in Ørestad Syd. Here the circular shape of the building softens the meeting between the city and nature. From the complete periphery of the school where the class rooms are located there’s a free view over the landscape. The materials of the school supports the buildings spatial concept and ideas of transparency: the circular shape is a visible concrete construction, the facade are fields of aluminium creating light and shadow plays and everywhere inside the building is wood used as a contrast to give a warm feeling and appearance. We are looking very much forward to welcoming you at Kalvebod Fælled School in summer 2018.
