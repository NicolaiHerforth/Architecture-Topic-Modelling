Julia and I visited Torvehallerne, which literally translates to amazing covered market with fresh foods of every kind and prepared food to melt your face off (I presume). Feast your eyes upon the case of smørrebrød, which literally translates to yummy things on bread (once again, I presume). #torvehallerne  #copenhagen #denmark
