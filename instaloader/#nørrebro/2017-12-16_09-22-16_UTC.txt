[iPhone 7. No filter. Contrast/Saturation/Sharpen: +40.] Last time when I was at the Assistens Cemetery, I heard pupils’ laughters and playing sounds coming from the school next to the cemetery. For a short moment I was brought out of the solemnity at the cemetery. It felt like some subtle harmony between the two disparate worlds of the living and the deceased, which reminded me a conversation that happened after my grandmother’s funeral, when I was 6.
Me: Mom, what is death?
My mother: It’s a natural process.
