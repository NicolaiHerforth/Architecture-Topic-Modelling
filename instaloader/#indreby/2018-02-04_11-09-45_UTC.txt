Don’t panic, it’s organic 💚
If every morning started like this, I would be the happiest food blogger in the entire universe...
.
An amazing spread of breakfast treats at the SP34 Hotel, probably the best hotel I have ever stayed at in Copenhagen.
Fresh breads, soft boiled eggs, yoghurt with different toppings, fresh fruit and jams, charcuterie, cheeses, freshly pressed juices and coffee. I mean, I just have no words, I just wanna move in and eat like this, all day errrr day 😍💫🍏🥝🍳🥐🥚🧀
Happy Sunday ya’ll!
