Every year in Febuary it’s a Danish tradition to celebrate Fastelavn. In Copenhagen a few do it on horseback. The horses are “dressed up” for the day and ride around Amager sinding and stopping by sponsors (local businesses) and mod-way they “beat down a barrel”. This is Cadi and Welsh cob part of the parade. #equinephotographer #equinephoto #equinephotography #equinesofinstagram #horse #photography #fastelavn #sundbyfastelavnsforening #amager #horsesofcopenhagen
