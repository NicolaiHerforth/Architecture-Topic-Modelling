I DON’T MEAN TO DINING SPAM YOU | but I just remembered this amazing @airbnb we stayed at a few years ago in Copenhagen. The owner was an art director and his taste was spot on if you like a scandi come minimalist come mid century modern look. This was his dining room which sat open plan with his lounge. Every corner of the apartment was filled with ‘cool stuff’ basically!
