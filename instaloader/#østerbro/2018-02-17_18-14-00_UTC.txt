With a slight hangover from a girls night out last night 💃🏼 we ventured out to see @kristian_jon_larsen temporary art installation commissioned by the Copenhagen Metro. 🚇 His installation is at the building site of a new station. Asger and I don’t pretend to know anything about abstract art, 🤷🏼‍♀️ but we were pretty impressed by his work. 👏🏻🖤🤟🏼#motherhood #rainbowbaby #lifeafterloss #parentingafterloss #østerbro #trianglen #østerbronx #fælledparken #urbanart #abstractart #modernart #contemporaryart #installationart #sculpture #mitkbh #delditkbh #copenhagen #citylife #byenshegn #metrohegn
