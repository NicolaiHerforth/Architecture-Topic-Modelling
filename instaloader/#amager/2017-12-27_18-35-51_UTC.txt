Off season at Kastrup Sea Bath (the Snail), an Award-winning open-air pool. A sculpture to walk on and dive from.

The purpose of the lighting at Kastrup Sea Bath, besides being functional and securing the safety of the visitor, is to offer a dramatic experience of the place at night and during the long dark off-season. The lighting is designed to emphasize the sculptural architectural design #visitdenmark #denmark #amager #visitamager #copenhagen #øresund #beach #kastrupsøbad #sneglen #seabath #kastrupseabath #kastrup #kigopkbh #thebestofscandinavia #deldinby #sharingcph #architecture  #typicalscandinavia #wood #design #visitcopenhagen #govisitdenmark #arkitektur #igers_denmark #iamnordic #snail #cloudscape
