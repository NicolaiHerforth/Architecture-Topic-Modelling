“Spinderiet”, Valby. The cotton factory (left) was build 1907 and closed by the end of the 1950s. It had its own nursery, Spindegården 1948-1965. Typical textile industry building with many and large windows to bring light inside. Then local crafters and industries moved in, until a shopping center was designed with old and new buildings 2007. Unlike many other shopping centers, is partly outdoor with a glass roof. Legendary union boss (SiD), Hardy Hansen (b. 1933) worked here for a short time until 1954. #spinderiet #valby #arkitektur #architecture #architecturelovers #total_denmark  #københavn #copenhagen #danskerneshistorie#københavn #copenhagen #aokdk #visitcopenhagen #igerscopenhagen #cphpicks #mitkbh  #nofilter #udenfilter #loves_united_copenhagen #tipkbh
