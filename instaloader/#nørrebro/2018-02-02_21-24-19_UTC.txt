Our social media correspondent Sophie is back in #Copenhagen! She recently visited the #AssistensKirkegÃ¥rd cemetery in #NÃ¸rrebro where #HansChristianAnderson was buried. He is most known for his #fairytales that have turned into #classicmovies such as #thelittlemermaid, #thumbelina, and #theprincessandthepea! ðŸ“š Although itâ€™s a cemetery, it is also a lovely spot to stroll through as the park is always filled with families, joggers, and people walking their dog. ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡°#letLITshowyoutheworld
