Pilestykket, Husvildebarakker,  1947. 72 barracks, designed by architect Frederik Christian Lund (1896-1984). Functionalism. They were made in Sweden, still painted “Swedish Red”, and made for German refugees from refugee camp Kløvermarkslejren. When they returned to Germany, the barracks were used for homeless. It was meant as a temporary solution, but later facilities were added and they still exist for permanent use. The lampposts in the background is the stadion Valby Idrætspark. The smoke: Avedøreværket.  #Valby #husvildebarakker #barracks #funktionalisme #functionalism #FrederikChristianLund #FCLund #arkitektur #architecture #architecturelovers #bygningskultur #bygningshistorie #danskerneshistorie #københavn #copenhagen #aokdk #visitcopenhagen #igerscopenhagen #cphpicks #mitkbh #canonphotography #nofilter #udenfilter #archi_focus_on #frostvejr #frostweather
