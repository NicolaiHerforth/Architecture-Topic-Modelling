Review 1342 - MurPhill 2017 Ed. - Amager Bryghus - Imperial Porter - ABV 10.5% - Bottle from @boxbeerscom - Oh wow! What a beast of a porter. This beer has been brewed before in 2012 together with Mike Murphy from Lervig and Shaun Hill from Hill Farmstead. What a power duo, or should I say power trio, 'cause @amagerbryghus has made quite a name for themselves over the years. In my opinion, their best beers are actually the ol' porter and stouts. This beauty is aged on fresh bourbon barrels and is just delicious. Aroma is potent and full of roasted malts, bourbon and licorice. Taste is sweet, but with that characteristic rye spice, rich roasted malts, dark fruity and a pleasant bourbon touch. Warming alcohol in the end, but very smooth overall with excellent characteristics from both the rye and the barrel aging. Superb porter I'd say, and probably Amager's best beer this year? 4.5/5.0 #amager #amagerbryghus #murphill #murphill2017 #danishcraftbeer #imperialporter #drinkitlikeyoumeanit #fortheloveofbeer #boxbeers #boxbeerscom #thebeernation #hopmaestro
