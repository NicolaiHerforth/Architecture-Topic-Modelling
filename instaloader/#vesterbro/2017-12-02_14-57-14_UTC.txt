#meetthestaff This is Ditte @kitten_kyhn our sommelier,the youngest student to finish the Scandinavian wine academy, waiter and excellent host.  She tries to offer as diverse wines as possible to widen the range to our customers. We take into account both the grape variety and the soil type in our choice and we therefore propose diverse and exciting wines from different wine regions. #meetthestaf #sommelier #passion #bodil #bodiletspisested
