I went for a walk today. Weather was amazing. I wish all sutumns would be this warm. I went to Vestre Cemetery in Valby, I had never been there before. Some of those family grave sites are crazy. Those people must have had a lot of money back then. The only famous people I found were politicians. Oooh and I saw a few squirrels 😁🐿🐿🐿 #squirrels #egern #vestrekirkegård #vestrecemetery #kirkegård #cemetery #autumn #efterår #sunday #søndag #walk #gåtur #familiegrave #gravesites #denmark #danmark #københavn #copenhagen #valby #ankerjørgensen #stauning #jensottokrag
