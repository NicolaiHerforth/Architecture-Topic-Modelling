NORDIC RACE😜 🏁 .
.
Everything has a first time and today was my first time loosing my wristband which means a disqualification. Only two females succeeded the race today and I was almost facing a third place as I was on my third and final round on the course whilst all others was way behind or out. .
As I started to realize my hands was totally numb on big rig I firstly was super frustrated and not satisfied. BUT putting all into a perspective I'm pretty okay with my race today and I had a pretty good comeback anyway. I know what I would like to work on during the winter and I know I'll come back stronger in 2018😉
.
I made it through big rig on first attempt on my two first rounds but after putting all my energy into a god damn slam ball obstacle my energy level was low. .
I hope you'll enjoy these small clips from the day - they show what a muddy mess we went through💩 and it shows how I need to take everything slow to keep the grip on the obstacles. It was damn tough! .
Thanks to everyone who cheered on the course🙏🏼
.
Btw I actually think and hope this experience today will make me train even harder and smarter as I really got to see that things doesn't come easy! :)
