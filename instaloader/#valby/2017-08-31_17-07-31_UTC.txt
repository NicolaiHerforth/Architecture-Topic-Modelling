We invite everyone for a great time at Valby Culture Days, starting tomorrow (Friday-Saturday). Let’s meet friends, family and new people, listen to good music and of course, drink some specialty coffee. We are going to be selling freshly brewed coffee and roasted coffee beans, starting from 2 P.M. Be sure to grab yours. Your purchase helps us with social projects in Ethiopia, visit our NGO Coffeeprint4Change.org
