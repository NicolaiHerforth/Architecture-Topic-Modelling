Brunch at @theunionkitchen had been on my list for such a long time...
Expectations were high, definitely. Based on the looks one might think that it was darn delicious. Yeah, you are right. They did not disappoint!
A menu that goes beyond your typical brunch options but that actually feels like breakfast and lunch items combined and intertwined. Pizza with kale, tomatoes and a fried egg; pulled pork with a poached egg, avocado and tortilla chips; steak and eggs, eggs benedictine, a few salads (that can be adapted to the vegan foodie as well) and I'm sure you get my drift.
You don't? Well, then go and see for yourself😏
A classic selection of cold and warm drinks and a tempting cocktail list round up a menu that is da bomb⭐️!
Why do you think I come back to Copenhagen so often? Well, food is a big big reason😍
P.s. special thanks to @sabrinapatricia for posing and bearing with my maniac need of getting THE best shot. We actually met through Instagram and talked about many things and we both see social media as a platform to connect and inspire💚
Cheers to life, good food, friends and Copenhagen. Ya'll have a grrrreat Wednesday!
