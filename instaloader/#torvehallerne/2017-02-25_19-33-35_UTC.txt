Porridge, and especially oatmeal, is one of my favorite dishes. It's so  versatile and there are some awesome combos out there. 🍲 The one I had today was Congee w/ chicken, ginger, peanuts, soya and sesame oil. 😏 I would definitely recommend it. Pop by Torve hallerne if you are in Copenhagen 😉 Usually I make it myself, but sometimes you have to treat yourself 😄
