Nothing on a Pelago bike is left to chance. For an example why put hydraulic disc brakes on a commuter bike? Here's the reason from @pelagobicycles themselves. -  In general, the more traditional rim brakes provide a solid grip, however they get more slippery when the rim is wet or snowy. For this reason we choose to equip our higher-end commuters, like this Airisto, with disk brakes that are not affected by weather. #pelagoairistocommuter
