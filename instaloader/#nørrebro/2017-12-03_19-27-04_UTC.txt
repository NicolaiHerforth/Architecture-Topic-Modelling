❤️🎄December 3rd🎄❤️
Third day of my positivity advent calendar. Would love it if you join in in the comments - see explanation below and previous posts 😊 The highlight of my day was spending the afternoon with @julie_v_cph & @insta_justitia_1479. Hanging out with these two ladies is always such a pleasure and so much fun. My cheeks are sore from laughing so much 😆 And as you can see, we saw Santa! Of course the Danish Santa’s “sleigh” is a bike! 😂🎅🏻🚲
.
I’m “hosting” a little positivity advent calendar here on Instagram 😃 Every day until Christmas, I’ll post a photo (in the afternoon/evening CET) and in the caption I’ll share something positive from my day. And I hope that some of you guys would join me by leaving a comment about something positive from YOUR day? 😊 It could be anything. Something that made you smile or laugh, something you're grateful for, something or someone that made your day - you name it. It’s all about collecting good thoughts and experiences, and by sharing them with each other, I’m sure we’ll get into the Christmas spirit 🎄❤️✨ What do you say? 😊
