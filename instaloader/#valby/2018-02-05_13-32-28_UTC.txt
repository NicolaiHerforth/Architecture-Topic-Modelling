Say hello to our new POWER BOWL 👋🏼 This delicious one-meal in a bowl consists of quinoa, avocado, carrots, cucumber, kale, red cabbage, radish sprouts and topped with sesame, sunflower, and hemp seeds along with our homemade hummus. You can add, at extra cost, an egg on the side for a little more protein as well 👍🏼 .
We have 3 homemade vegan dressings to choose from. 1. Spicy almond butter 2. Zesty tahini 3. Magic green sauce ( nut and oil free) 🙌🏼 .
We are so excited to serve you all such an awesome, healthy, Whole Food, vegan option for lunch. Come try it out, let us know what you think 🤗 hope you are all enjoying a little sunshine on this happy Monday 🌞 .
