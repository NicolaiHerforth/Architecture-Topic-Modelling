Valby Skole 1917, architect Hans Peter Jacobsen (1877-1943). Any passenger passing Valby by train must admire these beautiful old industrial buildings, now housing Valby Skole. They were built for Porcelænsfabrikken Norden (now Royal Copenhagen). The factory produced high resistant porcelain, able to resist 2 million Volt. When it closed in the 1980s, the school moved in.  #ValbySkole #Valby #Porcelænsfabrikken #HansPeterJacobsen #arkitektur #architecture #architecturelovers #danskerneshistorie #københavn #copenhagen #aokdk #visitcopenhagen #igerscopenhagen #cphpicks #mitkbh  #nofilter #udenfilter #loves_united_copenhagen #tipkbh
