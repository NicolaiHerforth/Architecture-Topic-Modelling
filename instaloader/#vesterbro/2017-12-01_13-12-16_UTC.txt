Transformation in progress! 
After three years on the drawing board, we have finally moved on site and initiated the renovation of the 140 dwellings and a new rooftop garden on Enghavevej in Copenhagen, DK. The two existing concrete blocks are wrapped in a new high insulating facade system, which maximise daylight and add new spacious private balconies. A green rooftop garden is established between the buildings, creating a new communal outdoor space for the residents. The construction is scheduled for completion ultimo 2018.
