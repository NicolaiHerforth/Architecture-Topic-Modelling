We were hoping to have dinner here but it closes at 4pm on Sundays. - Torvehallerne @torvehallernekbh 
It is not a supermarket â€“ it is a super market. At Torvehallerne in Copenhagen, you will find over 60 stands selling everything from fresh fish and meat to gourmet chocolate and exotic spices, as well as small places where you can have a quick bite to eat.
