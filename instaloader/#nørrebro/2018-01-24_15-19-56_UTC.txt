CPH: Authentic #Ethiopian food at Ma'ed Ethiopian Restaurant in Nørrebro that's perfect for these cold winter evenings and your end of the month bank balance. I had a hearty Alicha Doro Wat - chicken on the bone cooked in a delicious mild curry sauce and served with s hard boiled egg and yoghurt on top of an injera, the traditional sourdough-risen flat bread. No bookings taken but get here early as this understated restaurant is very popular!
