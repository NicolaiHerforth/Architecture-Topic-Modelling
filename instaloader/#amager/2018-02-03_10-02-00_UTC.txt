104 parkruns and it never gets boring😊
I had a lot of excuses this morning: a cold day with icy patches, feeling tired from a long run and dinner with friends yesterday...
But I did what always works: one foot in front of the other, follow the arrows and stay clear of the ice 🏃🏼‍♀️ My motivation for pushing myself in training is really increased by my #parkrun community - I am not sure everybody knows my name, but they know about running 💥 Fast or slow, we all get up early Saturday morning to give what we have 🔥
