Here's another beer shared at that housewarming party a few weeks back - a collab between @amagerbryghus and John Laffler (formerly of @gooseisland  and currently of @offcolorbrewing). This rye beer is pretty savory, bringing lots of soy sauce, licorice and leather notes alongside the more chocolatey flavors. There was also a pretty strong mineral flavor which contributed to the bitterness. Malts were nice and roasty, with some cacao nibs and coffee present. While I'm not the biggest fan of the style, it's no question that this is a delightfully complex brew! Anyone else tried this one before?
