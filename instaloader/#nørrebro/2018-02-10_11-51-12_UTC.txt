This might look like a pool, but in fact it’s a skylight at the end of a staircase in a kindergarten in Copenhagen named “Forfatterhuset”. The full-length railings are for safety measures as you can see in the ensuing pictures. You’ll also find a picture of the beautiful orange exterior of the kindergarden by Cobe Architects (2014). This particular architect studio seems, in fact, architecturally in recent years to have taken over Copenhagen with their spectacular works. It might just now be appropriate to talk of “Cobenhagen” as one of my followers jokingly phrased it in a comment to my post yesterday, which btw. also featured a Cobe building.
