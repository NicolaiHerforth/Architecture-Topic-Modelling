Local, Organic, Zero Waste #groceries are totally an option in #Copenhagen! 
L√òS Market @loesmarket in #Vesterbro makes it simple! 
Bring your own containers, weigh them, then fill ‚Äòem up with #packagefree goods. 
They also sell reusable jars (beautiful glass #weck jars), #GOTS certified produce/grain bags, and have a selection for free in case you need one!

Besides produce, grains, nuts, flours, eggs, spices, coffee, tea, and oil, they have all the soap you need, from dishes to the shower, among some other goodies! You can even slice your own bar of soap from a larger one!

#Vancouver has yet to have a #zerowaste grocery store, but NADA is on the way - keep your eyes peeled for their opening @nadagrocery (WE. ARE. SO. PUMPED). In my basket from #l√∏smarket:
- bananas
- oranges
- apples
- mushrooms - cucumber
- avocado (guaranteed)
- yams
- eggs
- popcorn
- pasta
- coffee (in a @weckjars I purchased)

Thank you for your hard work and persistence in getting this Zero Waste shop going, and thank you to all the Danes who are choosing to slow down while shopping, consume less, consume consciously, create less waste, and consider where their food is coming from #‚ôªÔ∏è#‚úåüèΩ#üçé .
