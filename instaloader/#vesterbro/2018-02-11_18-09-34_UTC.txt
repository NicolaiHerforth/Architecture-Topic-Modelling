🔹WHY SO GOOD? 
Grown by hand on the clay cliffs that descend from Mount Poro towards the sea between Cape Vaticano, Zambrone, Tropea and Briatico, in the provinces of Cosenza and Vibo Valentia, the Tropea onion was brought to Calabria by the Greeks, who had discovered it thanks to the Assyrians and Babylonians. However, it was the Arabs who perfected its cultivation in Tropea, where they settled for some time, and contributed to its spreading through the region.

. 🔹THE TASTE 
The shape of its bulbs, of a deep purple color, vary from round to oval to elongated. The onion’s extraordinary sweetness, its delicate scent, its lightness and enjoyable taste, which derive from the morphological peculiarities of the soil and microclimate where it is grown, make it a much sought after ingredient by gourmets and chefs.
