Join us when we open NIGHT IN THE OASIS this Thursday, February 1 at 5 p.m. @copenhagenlightfestival has swathed the façade of the museum in red light and has transformed its very own oasis – the Winter Garden - into a sanctuary in the big city desert. Link in bio for more info about the opening and the installation.
