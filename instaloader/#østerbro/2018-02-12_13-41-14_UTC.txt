Ever heard of BEE’S WRAP? It’s a reusable wrapping paper made of natural bees wax, organic cloth, tree resin and organic jojoba oil. It keeps your food naturally fresh and is the perfect alternative to plastic. You cover your food and seal the wrap with the warmth of your hands 🙏🏻🐝💚 #sustainable #foodstorage #beeswax #wrap #beeswrap #kitchenutensils #hahnemannskøkken #østerbro #copenhagen #sustainablelifestyle #greenliving
