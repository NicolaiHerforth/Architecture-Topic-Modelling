CPH: It’s Chinese New Year’s Eve and I’ve been missing London’s dim sum scene and all the great Chinese takeaways and restaurants. I immediately thought of Noodle House serving Copenhagen’s most authentic Chinese flavours. I was recommended these crab Crystal dumplings, I had to have potstickers, the beef ho fun and their tasty char siu stir fry with cheung fun rice pasta in a spicy Szechuan sauce. My photos don’t do it justice!
