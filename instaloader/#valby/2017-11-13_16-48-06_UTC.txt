I know it sounds weird but I've been thinking about Post Malone a lot the last two weeks. While procrastinating the work on my BA project today I googled interviews with Post Malone and on my sunset adventure just before I kept thinking about how I'm exactly to months older than him. Also how weird is it that his real name is Austin Richard Post. (I need to see real people)
