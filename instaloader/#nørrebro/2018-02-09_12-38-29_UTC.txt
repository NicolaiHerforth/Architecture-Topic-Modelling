If you enjoy a well deserved delicious Vegan / Veggi meal like we do here at ilovekombuca (15 year and counting😉) we can recommend you to try out Kate's Joint a Vegan/Vegetarian - Asian/Indian fusion kitchen in the heart of Nørrebronz. They serve a particular tasty Curry🌟👍 (and our organic Booch ofc! 😉)
