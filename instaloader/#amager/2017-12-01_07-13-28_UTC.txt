FIND THE ALMOND, WIN A BRUNCH! In Danish tradition, the lucky finder of a hidden almond in the Christmas dessert gets a prize! Throughout December, we will hide an almond in one of our delicious Chia a l’amande desserts every day from Monday to Friday at either Lergravsvej or in Hellerup – and the lucky finder wins a new free brunch! Best of luck!
