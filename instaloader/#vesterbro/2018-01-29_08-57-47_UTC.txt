After a long period with school, traveling, and family it’s finally time to decorate my new apartment in Vesterbro, Copenhagen. I have always been happy about living in the city, so I know this apartment is perfect since it’s located only 5 min from Copenhagen Town Hall. Please let me know, what you think about my decorating! Enjoy your Monday! 🙏😊👍 ___________________________________________________________
