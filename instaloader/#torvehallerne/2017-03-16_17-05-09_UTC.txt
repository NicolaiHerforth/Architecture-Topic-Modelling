I had a great job interview today at Radisson Blu Royal Copenhagen ☺
Just to spoil myself i visited Copenhagens food market later on , a pleace I really wanted to visit for a long time. I tried a Vietnamese Bao with five spice pork. Mmmmmm..... Delicious 😋
Well my brownie  and my coffee ☕ were just as good. 
I was in #love with this place ❤
