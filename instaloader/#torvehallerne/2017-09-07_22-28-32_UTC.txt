Three young women enjoyed the last bit of evening sun on a bench next to where we started drawing.
.
“A music note?” One guessed after the glans and one leg were finished. “What is it?”
.
“Why don’t we keep drawing and you keep guessing?”
.
“Sounds good!”
.
After the outline of the other leg was complete, they guessed again, “Scissors?”
.
“Not quite,” we answered.
.
After we finished the rest, they said they still weren’t sure. Then, we explained that it was a clitoris.
.
Immediately, two of the women looked at the third. “That’s what she thought! But she didn’t want to say it aloud.”

'Mere end en ært' means 'More than a pea' in Danish. Thank you to the lovely Danes that helped make this first international adventure possible :)
