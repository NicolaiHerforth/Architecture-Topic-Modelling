When you don’t eat the same food in a household - you can still make delicious food without it being to troublesome. Same soup made of cabbage / carrots/ garlic/ green chili paste / salt / pepper and potatoes. One is served plain topped with red pepper and cilantro - the other one is served with steamed cod / lime and cilantro. Bon appetit ❤️
