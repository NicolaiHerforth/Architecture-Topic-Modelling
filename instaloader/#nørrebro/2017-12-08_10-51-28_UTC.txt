Playing around with makeup, eyebrows and accessories, her whole appearance changes every time something is added/removed/altered🙂 -
My little drawing business is now almost a whole year old and I’ve NEVER had a year go by this quickly, it’s insane.
These days I’m contemplating a lot, looking back on all the experiences I’ve had as a freelance illustrator and knowing I still have so so much to learn. I feel like I’ve only just scratched the surface of what it’s like being my own boss and being responsible for everything from filing taxes, getting commissions, working with deadlines and doing PR for my own work while also maintaining another job, kids, a home and my own mental health.

I don’t like to plan too long ahead and be all ‘new year new me’ (because people make plans and God laughs😗), but for the first time ever I’ve started on a serious journey towards healing the childhood traumas that have been sitting in me for 34 years and all I can wish for is that this journey will somehow bring some balance into my work life as well. That is the only thing I can hope for as we soon enter 2018, as well as a healthy family🙏🏼
