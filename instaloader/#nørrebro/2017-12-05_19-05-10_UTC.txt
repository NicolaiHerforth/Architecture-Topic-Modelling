The most special gems are the ones that are the most obvious, but often overseen💎 
I remember as an early college graduate, broke and without a dime to my name I was always dreaming of buying a “real” camera from this place. It closed a long time ago and now sells cheap candy, but some of it is still there... for me its a piece of history, I hope they never take it down🙏🏼
