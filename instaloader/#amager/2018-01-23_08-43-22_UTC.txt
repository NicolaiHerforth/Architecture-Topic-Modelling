A day care center for 170 kids at Amager in Copenhagen. The building contains 10 kindergartens and nurseries. Architects are ONV Architects. The theme is undoubtedly red. No wonder that the whole complex is called “The Red Corner”. The red facades has btw caused complaints from the neighbors because of the reflections. The white chimney in the background is, as you’ve surely have guessed, not a integral part of any children factory. #børnehuset #detrødehjørne #onvarkitekter #newarchitecture #kindergarten #architecture #architettura #architecturephotography #architecturalphotography #architecturelovers #architectureporn #architecturestudents #architecturestudent #architects #contemporaryarchitecture #architettura #arkitektur #architecturehunter #modernarchitecture #architecturelover #architecturephoto #newbuilding #amager #danskarkitektur #kidsarchitecture #kindergartens #architektur #architectureandpeople #architecturephoto
