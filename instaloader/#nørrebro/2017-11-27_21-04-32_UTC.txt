Celebrating innovation üí° The Maersk Tower is a new center for research and education in health and lifestyle diseases at the University of Copenhagen. 
A third of the 3,300 copper shutters of the facade are made of transparent expanded metal that move in accordance with the sun. This changes the look of the facade during the day, reducing the energy consumption for cooling by protecting the building from the sun.

The Maersk Tower has won several international awards for its unique look and functionality ‚Äì most recently the European Copper in Architecture Award 2017 last week. 
A big congratulations to C.F. M√∏ller Architects and thanks for adding this gem to the Copenhagen skyline.
