Thank you Jakob Melander. For taken time to meet me and thank you for the books .I feel blessed.On my desk is more than 1000 pages of genuine literature .The meeting reminds me of the giant and the ant.Me in the role of the ant.I spoke alot and loud for silence all the pages I haven't wrote.#Jakobmelander#fiction#novel#giant#noerrebro#nørrebro#copenhagen#dinby#indreby#vesterbro#openmind#genius#thankfull#leaning😁
