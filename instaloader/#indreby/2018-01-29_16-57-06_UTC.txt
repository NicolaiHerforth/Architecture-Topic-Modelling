Thank you to everyone who came to see Sleeping Beauty! The supportive and engaged audience members, our dedicated and hard-working crew and our talented and enthusiastic cast made for an incredible show that is hard to say goodbye to. ðŸ‘¸ðŸ’¤ðŸ‘‹ If youâ€™re feeling the post-show blues too, not to worry! We have new, exciting events and performances coming soon. First up, we have the next Open Stage on 16 February followed by a play reading on 19 February. Next we will be holding auditions for Cabaret on 3-4 March. And donâ€™t forget, our next main stage show, Pride & Prejudice, takes the stage 18-28 April (and tickets are already available)! We canâ€™t wait to see you at one of our events soon. ðŸŽ­ðŸŽ‰âœ¨ Photos by Hubert Baumeister
