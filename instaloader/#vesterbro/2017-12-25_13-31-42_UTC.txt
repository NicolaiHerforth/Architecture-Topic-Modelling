Scandanavian holidays. ❤️ Hindy Weber-Tantoco, a former Metro Society cover girl, is with family in Vesterbro, Copenhagen. Located just outside the city center, Vesterbro is a great destination pick for a home away from home during the holidays. Enjoy the amusement park rides at Tivoli Gardens, explore Copenhagen’s Museum and experience a taste sensation at the food street. With the abundance of great restaurants, an awesome nightlife scene, the Meatpacking District, cool music haunts and boutique art galleries, and Westmarket (the new gourmand haven), there is something for everyone.
