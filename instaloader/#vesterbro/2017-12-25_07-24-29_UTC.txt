You know what time of year it is when these guys show up. Practicing their yoga poses while patiently waiting for their Açai Bowls. The tall guy said they’d been working like crazy for weeks. Now they needed to focus on taking good care of themselves. Sounds like good advice.  Merry Christmas!🌲🎅🏼❤️
