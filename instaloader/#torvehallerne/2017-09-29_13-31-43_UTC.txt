SMØRREBROD - second day for #smørrebrød in the #torvehallerne. So good (and so pretty) with snaps and beer and we didn't realise we had to book for the other place we'd planned to go instead. Oh and the #knitwear? Well, it's not really #sweaterspotting if I mended the cardigan that @vergeetmijnietjes bought at  a charity that fits @postartschoolclub perfectly. It is from @harrods though - fancy ;)
