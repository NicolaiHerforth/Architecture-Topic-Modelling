@Regranned from @hopmaestro -  Review 1361 - Maureen the Maverick Moonshiner - Amager Bryghus - Imperial Stout - ABV 12.0% - Bottle from @boxbeerscom - Time for a fat BA stout from @amagerbryghus current bourbon barrel aged-series. I had the "Patrizio" old ale recently, check my feed for that one, and it was awesome. So expectations were high. Aroma sure is bourbon BA all the way. Regular stout notes like roasted malts and dark chocolate, but the BBA cuts like a knife and gives vanilla, oak and bourbon. Taste is sweet, brown sugar and molasses. Thick and oily beer. Light charred and burnt notes, with bourbon and licorice. It's very full flavored, almost too much. Let it rest in the glass for a while to take down the massive taste. Y'all know I like my beers bold and exaggerated, and if you are like me, you'll love this one. Phat stuff! 4.5/5.0 #amagerbryghus #amager #maureenthemaverickmoonshiner #imperialstout #bbaimperialstout #danishcraftbeer #boxbeers ##devotedtothecraft #craftbeer #drinkitlikeyoumeanit #thebeernation #hopmaestro #boxbeerscom - #regrann
