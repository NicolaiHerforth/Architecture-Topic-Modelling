Today, I have spent 4 and half years out in England and in 5 days I will be able to finally say mission accomplished my formal education, master’s degree will be complete and thus I am feeling a bit nostalgic. I haven’t ever really had much time to reflect but - It’s been surreal at times out here. I never thought I’d accomplish half the things I have - from getting a 1st class degree, to making a film about the plight of Syrian refugees, to film nominations, to awards, to doing interviews on television and radio on topics relevant to the media landscape and refugee crisis, to a full scholarship, to film festivals and now nearly a master’s degree - what happened!? I didn’t do very well in art in high school :D 
Anyways, I miss my hometown Copenhagen dearly and it might be time to go back for a little while - it was very hard leaving the first time. See you soon CPH! Oh and I have to shout out Regensens knows how to party! :D Some very bright students assembled there :D No matter what's going on in the world today - everywhere that I go all I see is beautiful people. :) Peace and Love :) -
