Be careful what you wish for. Wishes do come true,  as long as you work hard to make it happen and ready to make sacrifices.  Does it worth if? Would you regret getting your dream come true, but loosing something you had before?  You will never know until you try. If the wish is deep in your heart you will never regret,  no matter what happens on the way
