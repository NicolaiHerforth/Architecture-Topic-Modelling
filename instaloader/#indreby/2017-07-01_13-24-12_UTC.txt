It's amazing so many different nice people popping into my shop on a Saturday. 😊😎😍 The couple who came all the way from Israel to get married in Copenhagen Town Hall this morning. Mummy paid for their shirts. 💙💙💖 And the young ballet dancer who is performing Askepot in Pantomime theater in Tivoli. She loved the dresses in my shop.👗👒 And the Blogger from the Faroe Islands who took this photo for a Magazine. 🌏🌐
Love you all! 💋💋💋
