During 20 minutes by the water around my morning dip, I chatted with two swans, four tourists, a fellow swimmer, and a photographer.. Everyone could feel the bliss, the gratitude, the sense that the world does not need us to make meaning of it. It holds meaning right there, in front of us, inside our entangled lives.
