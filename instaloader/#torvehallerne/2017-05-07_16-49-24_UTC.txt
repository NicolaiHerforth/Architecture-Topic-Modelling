Sm√∏rrebr√∏d (I was told it is pronounce as 'smuhr-broht') or open-face sandwich is truly a unique Danish food experience. Typically rye bread is used and you can have limitless different toppings & garnishes. These were freshly made and beautifully presented. I went with the meatballs, potato salad, onions & chives topping. Delish! üëçThis food market @torvehallernekbh where I had tasted this national dish is a must-go place when in Copenhagen especially you foodies out there! #ArtOnAPlate
