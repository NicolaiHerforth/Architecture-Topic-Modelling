You might not know it, but Hepcats Copenhagen is a non-profit organisation run solely on the power of our volunteers - be they board members, teachers, DJs, you name it - nobody receives salary for what they do. It is done out of the love for dance and what they can give to the community from their hearts.
We have our annual general assembly coming up on Sunday June 18th at 13.00 at @kulturhusetindreby 
We need a new boost of energy and would love to see new members in the board as we unfortunately are losing a couple of our current members.
Meet up, have your say and join our volunteer family!
