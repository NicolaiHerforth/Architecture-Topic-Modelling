Brown Boobies Falling, Imperial Porter 7.5% Amager Bryghus Kastrup Denmark in collaboration with Lervig Stavanger Norway.

Another day.. another review and i guess there will plenty to review over the next days cause round noon Monika and i will travel to Gouda for a bottleshare with our friends Mike and Diana, and during yesterdays check we already came to the conclussion that we have planned way to many big bottles, so.. we see where it will end ðŸ˜‰
Shared this conconut porter with Monika last night.
A collaboration team that brings high expectations... Amager and Lervig!
Again some nice artwork on the label by Simon Hartvig Daugaard, and a funny saga story about the first Portuguee sailors setting foot on the Maladives Island, falling asleep under palmtrees after beeing lost and getting conconuts on their heads while sleeping. Plus.. a fact that the first coconut porter would have been brewed at the Maladives.
The beer now... it's a very nice Imperial porter, very tasty as to expect from these 2 brewerys.
Loads of dark chocolate, powerful bitterness, coffee, roast, caramel, only missing one thing... the coconut. Only tasted a little hint in the finish of it but that was about it, and that was a pitty.
Specialy cause the beer is all about coconut, but anyway.. beside this it's still a great and tasty beer.
Enjoy weekend and.... Cheers!
