Built in 1913, Helgoland is one of the oldest sea baths in Copenhagen. Until the 1970s this is where many Copenhagen children learned to swim, and it has been the home of the winter swimmer’s club, Det Kolde Gys (The Cold Rush), since 1929. In 2008, Helgoland reopened after four years of refurbishment, but before it was dismantled many of its wooden planks were sold at auction to sentimental regulars. #helgoland #helgolandbadeanstalt #amager #amagerstrand #visitamager #cphpicks #badeanstalt #seabath #søbad #swimming #øresund #voreskbh #govisitdenmark #visitcopenhagen #visitdenmark #sharingcph #igersdenmark #igerscopenhagen #loves_copenhagen #loves_denmark #loves_united_denmark #typicalscandinavia #iamnordic #thebestofscandinavia #publicbath
