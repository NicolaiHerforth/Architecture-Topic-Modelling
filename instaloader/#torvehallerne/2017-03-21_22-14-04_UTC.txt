One of my favorite spots in Copenhagen is @torvehallernekbh, a diverse market square with plenty of food to choose from!  Here's what we had for lunch: 
Photos 1 & 2- smørrebrød (Danish open sandwiches) from Hallernes Smørrebrød.  These unique open sandwiches are a must try if you visit Denmark! 
3- tuna, salmon, and edamame from Hav2Go.  Looks a Danish poke bowl! 
4 & 5 - pastries from @briochedoreedk 
6- pastry from Sweet Valentine.  It tasted like a slice of cake covered in pie dough and chocolate powder 😍
