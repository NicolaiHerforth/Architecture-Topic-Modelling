I don't like new year's resolutions but it's good to set goals and challenge yourself so I decided to create a goal for this year 🏆
The goal is to visit a new city every month for the rest of the year 🗺
It actually started in November 2017 when I visited Rome 🇮🇹 followed by Morocco 🇲🇦 in December and Copenhagen 🇩🇰 in January 🎉 
So now it is time for a new city but I haven't made any plans yet. Does anyone know a great city to go to in February?
 P.S. it doesn't have to be a new country just a new city (cause I am really broke)
