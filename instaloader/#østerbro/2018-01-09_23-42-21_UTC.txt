Will never forget the concert given by 2 of my favorite bands.- D-A-D @d.landafterdark and Dizzy mizz lizzy @dizzymizzlizzyofficial
As a prank (i guess), D-A-D brought out an old drumset with Dizzy Mizz Lizzy logo on an burned it while playing. Im sure Dizzy Mizz Lizzy was informed... maybe they even provided the drumset themselves :)
Either way, it was an awesome concert by both of the bands. Was thrilled to see Dizzy Mizz Lizzy reunited. We actually flew back to DK from Italy just to see the concert. Thank you for a blast!
