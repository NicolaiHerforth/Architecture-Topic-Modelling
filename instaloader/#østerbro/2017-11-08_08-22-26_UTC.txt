A former silo at the new Nordhavn neighbourhood in Copenhagen. The slick concrete tower silo was thoroughly transformed by Praksis Architects (2017) into housing with a facade covered in a grid of pillars and a flow of balconies. The 13 storey high tower is named "Frihavnstårnet". #praksisarkitekter #architettura #architettura #architecture #newarchitecture #contemporaryarchitecture #nordhavn #danisharchitecture #architecturephotography #architecturalphotography #architecturelovers #architectureporn #architecturestudents #architecturestudent #architecture_hunter #architizer #delditkbh #cphpicks #arkitektur #silo #arch_more #architecturelove #architektur #frihavnstårnet #frihavnen #østerbro #housing #balcony #balconies
