Most of my December runs take place in darkness. This afternoon I worked from home and managed to run on the Common in grey and wet conditions 🏃🏼‍♀️🌧 I really enjoyed it, just me out there and a deer happily jumping the fences 😊 #run #runner #running #runninggirl #runnerslife #runnersofinstagram #løb#træning #Amager #vestamager #ørestad #københavnerjyde
