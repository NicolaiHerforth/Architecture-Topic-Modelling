Review 1353 - Patrizio the Persuasive Peacemaker - Amager Bryghus - Old Ale - ABV 10.5% - Bottle from @boxbeerscom - Old ales aren't really the hottest shit around, but I guess when @amagerbryghus gets going it could be worth a try? To further enhance the experience, this one is bourbon barrel aged, which probably will make it even tastier. As always, the story on the label and the magnificent artwork by @hartvig_hartvig is totally on point. Aroma is full of sweet molasses, spices and bourbon drenched autumn fruits. Taste is sweet, big and bold. You get nuts, caramel, wet wood, fruit cake, light tobacco and well rounded and delicious bourbon notes. This bastard was fucken delicious. I'm sorry for what I said about old ales in the beginning. 4.25/5.0 #amager #amagerbryghus #patriziothepersuasivepeacemaker #oldale #BAoldale #danishcraftbeer #boxbeerscom #drinkitlikeyoumeanit #fortheloveofbeer #thebeernation #hopmaestro #boxbeers
