I had just written a whole paragraph leading up to the point about acting upon our passions and supporting each other along the way. But now it's gone. I used too many hashtags I think...ðŸ˜µ Anyways I'm coming across now. Seriously don't let anyone tell you you can't do something. Whatever is in your box of creativity unpack it, love and use it. Work on it. Improve. Learn. Take chances. You might end up fulfilling your true purpose in life and help a lot of people along your path. Moving mountains could become an easy act. I found my passion but I keep on listening to my heart and discovering what I'm good at. Also I try not to force against life when it brings obstacles and bad feelings. Its all part of the package and by letting go and acting upon my passions I slip into life effortlessly. Join me on the path, you have my support and tell your close ones to come too. We can all share, support and create Ideas that change who we are and others as well. My friend said this is a very typical unoriginal ending for this post. But I really feel like this. I feel like more people could improve their life by incorporating this mindset into their everyday and maybe find their passions along the way. What is your passion? â€¢
