I was warned before I came here that #Scandinavia can be incredibly gloomy during the winter months especially after Christmas and New Year. I didn’t think it would affect me until now. It’s late January and I can’t seem to remember what summer feels like. They are very good at keeping things #hyggeligt however, with all the warm yellow lights and candles. This picture was taken around September when the air was still nice and cool, and the sun so warm that staying home will give you a severe case of FOMO.

The point of this picture is to show you my first #pottery #studio. I was lucky enough to meet @keramikkatrine who introduced me to this #awesome shared studio on #Saxogade, #Vesterbro. There were about 10 other #potters who love to come in and work on their #craft. Everyone is extremely talented and kind. I actually really miss coming here at night. A lot of times I would be the only one working in the studio. Then, I would turn on P8 Jazz radio, work until 2AM and bike home. Sometimes, I would invite my friends for a pottery party – wine and everything. This studio has all the tools and amenities; you really only need to buy your #clay.  If you are new to #Copenhagen and would like to rent a space in a pottery studio, I highly recommend this place. I’m not sure if they have space at the moment but you can DM me and I will ask for you.

Tusind tak Katrine, for at introducere mig til denne #keramikværksted!

私が#デンマーク で働いた最初の#陶器スタジオ は#ヴェスターブロ にあります。本当に静かで居心地の良い場所でした。#懐かしい 〜！仕事に一番集中できる時は誰もいない夜でした。#陶器 を作っている間にジャズを聞くのが大好きです。
