❤️🎄December 5th🎄❤️
5th day of my positivity advent calendar. Would love it if you’d join in in the comments - see explanation below and previous posts 😊 The positive experience of my day is happening right now. I’m enjoying some down time after a long day ☺️ I’m lying on my couch, under a blanket with a hot water bottle at my feet 😍 and I’m listening to one of Alan Watts’ talks. Ahhh, that’s a nice and relaxing way to end the day 😊
.
I’m “hosting” a little positivity advent calendar here on Instagram 😃 Every day until Christmas, I’ll post a photo (in the afternoon/evening CET) and in the caption I’ll share something positive from my day. And I hope that some of you guys would join me by leaving a comment about something positive from YOUR day? 😊 It could be anything. Something that made you smile or laugh, something you're grateful for, something or someone that made your day - you name it. It’s all about collecting good thoughts and experiences, and by sharing them with each other, I’m sure we’ll get into the Christmas spirit 🎄❤️✨ What do you say? 😊
