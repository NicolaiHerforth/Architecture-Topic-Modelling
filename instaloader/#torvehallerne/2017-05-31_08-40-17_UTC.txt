We have decided to leave Copenhagen and plant our roots elsewhere, at least for a while. I still have mixed feelings about that decision because I love Copenhagen so much. The food, the bicycle culture, the fact that it is small yet international... So I have decided to share some of the things I love the most over the coming weeks before we pack our things. This is also a welcome excuse to revisit all my favourite places! As a neighbour to @torvehallernekbh I come here, or at least pass through, every day and I will miss them so badly. I am a regular @coffeecollectif not only here but also in their other cafés, like the new one on Nørrebro or the main shop in Frederiksberg just below where I used to have an office desk. Their coffee is always perfect, the atmosphere light and airy and the soft ice is just such a treat on a hot day (here with my dear @kette_maa ). #whatiloveaboutcopenhagen #leavingcopenhagen #coffeecopenhagen #torvehallerne #kbhk
