Hello hello! We are Edhem (@edhem_jesenkovic) and Merete (@meretehersvik), and we live in the very heart of #Nørrebro / #Copenhagen. This week we are doing the #instatakeover, and we are very exited! A little bit about us; Edhem is from Bosnia, but has been living in Scandinavia for almost 25 years.. He is educated from the Royal Swedish Ballet School, and after a career working internationally as a dancer, he is now working as a freelance choreographer/performer based in CPH. Merete is from Norway, and has been living in Denmark for 3 years. She has a BA in contemporary dance from Oslo National Academy of the Arts (KHiO), and is currently dancing with @danskdanseteater in #operaenpåholmen. We look forward to sharing our week with you, and please ask if you have any questions! 💃🏽🕺🏻😊
