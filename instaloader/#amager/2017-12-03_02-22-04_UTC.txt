“Southtip Sunset”
- Wonderful dike/path around the southern tip of Copenhagens eastern Island Amager. Very nice and peaceful, but racebike-freaks also love it for it’s miles and miles without cars, crossings or lights, so keep your eyes open 😄. #letsgoforawalk #igscandinavia #delditkbh #mitkbh #dike #amager #getonyourbike #bikingcopenhagen #natureinthecity #citynature #copenhagensunset #decembersun #deichkind #nordischbynature #🌞 #🌊 #igersdenmark #igerscopenhagen
