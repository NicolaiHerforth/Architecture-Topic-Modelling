Three rectangular lakes (Sortedam Lake, Peblinge Lake and Sankt Jørgen Lake) curving around the western margin of the city centre are forming one of the oldest and most distinctive features of the city’s topography. The paths around them are popular with strollers, bikers and runners. Lakes are fantastic every time of the year! 🌊🐦 Do you like them too? 😍
