We welcome you to  join our winter happening Saturday the 16th of December, to get away from the stressful Christmas shopping and praise the winter sun. With beer, music, chilled icecream with gin & tonic  or baileys , play some of our board games  and ”Get what you get” tattoo deals chosen by your luck in our new ironball-maze. With unique winter designs like pinecones, floral and many more -  may the tattoo spirits decide your destiny. ”Get what you get” tattoo deals

For this event we built ourselves an ironball-maze. Here you will get the opportunity to aim and shoot at your chosen path and get a original design tattooed in the name of the Solstice spirit. For only 500 Kr. a shot*

Come by for a cold beer and a nice chat. Be sure to bring your friends!

Can’t wait to see you all. * One shot is 500 Kr. No refunds
