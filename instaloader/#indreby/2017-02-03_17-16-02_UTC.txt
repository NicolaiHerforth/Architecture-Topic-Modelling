The old quarter of the University of Copenhagen, like many universities in Europe, is nestled right within the old town district and in many ways blends right in with the surrounding urban fabric. Within the courtyard of the Frue Plads (Main Building) you can connect with the historic university and adjacent Vor Frue Kirke (Church of Our Lady) on a more intimate level.
