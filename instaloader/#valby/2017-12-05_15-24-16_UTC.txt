Christmas Basket - Ethiopian Coffee Body Scrub
---------------------------------
The body scrub was developed by Impact Roasters team, and its inspiration stems from our aspiration for a more sustainable way of living.

The coffee grounds used as a base for the body scrub is a waste product, and we decided to put it to good use.

With a base of almond oil, coconut sugar, cinnamon and scented with peppermint essential oil the body scrub is to exfoliate, moisturize and antioxidize your skin.

The Ethiopian coffee body scrub is part of our Christmas Basket, but it can also be purchased separately at our roastery and coffee shop at Langgade st.
