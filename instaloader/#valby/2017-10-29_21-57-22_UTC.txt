My old man!! 👶=👴Today was like my son said: Mom was a long and beautiful conversation that we had. 5 years!! and start it the hard and difficult questions to answer 😥😅 but also at the same time to know, how much is his desire to grow up and be an adult and let me know, like who he wants to be: "his FARFAR NIELS" 😄👴 (fordi han er super seje) 😎😄He wants to be an adult and So tall!! and do what his FARFAR does with his garden. He definitely loves and enjoys the weekends with his grandparents. Thanks a lot for giving your love and attention to my little old man 😂 💆‍♂️❤to double as my family will love to do as well (my mom and brother) but they sadly can't because there are on the other side of the world 😅😓🌎
