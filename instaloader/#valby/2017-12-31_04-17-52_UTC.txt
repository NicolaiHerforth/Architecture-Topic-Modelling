Valby Station, early morning. This is where most of my hikes start - and end. The station is the second (1911), the first existed 1847-1864. Tracks for international, national, local and metropolitan lines, the latter shown on the photo, from 1934. In 1950-1953 the station expanded. Do I need to mention that the architect was Heinrich Wenck, my honoured followers? Tonite is showdown for 2017. Happy New Year! I wish you the very best in 2018, see you there. #heinrichwenck #earlymorning #tidligmorgen #ValbyStation #station #Valby #stog #train #danskerneshistorie #k√∏benhavn #copenhagen #aokdk #visitcopenhagen #igerscopenhagen #cphpicks #mitkbh  #nofilter #udenfilter #loves_united_copenhagen #tipkbh
