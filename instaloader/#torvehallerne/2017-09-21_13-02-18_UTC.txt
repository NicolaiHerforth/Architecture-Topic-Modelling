Tomorrow at noon (12) we release 3 new @mikkellersd beers. 2 NE style cans and 3 different barrel aged bottled versions of our @superstitionmeadery collaboration Braggot Ale. The bottles and the Tremolo Beer Gut are extremely limited so first come first served. Also the M is for Murker can is a wet hopped Ipa. So all in all very exciting releases. Ja tak 🍻😜
