Wishing to be in Copenhagen right right now eating that delicious food and enjoying life to the fullest.
Not that the Stockholm's food scene isn't great but Copenhagen is definitely another level.
@fars.dreng delivers one of the best brunch experiences in town, with a menu that constitutes only of people-pleaser dishes, fantastic, delicious and so so pretty.
My crew that day consisted of serious foodies and Instagrammers as well, and we were literally the loudest, funniest and coolest table in da house, modesty aside🙈⭐️.
When in Copenhagen make sure to visit this place. And if you haven't been yet to Cph, then may this be one of the reasons for your first visit.
Brunch is served amigos, enjoy and eat as much as you can😍
