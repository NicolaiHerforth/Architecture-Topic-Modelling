TGIF😘❤️🍻 Tasted the "rebrew" of Carlsberg 1883 - the new release of a dark lager from... Yes, 1883. There is an interesting video on UT presenting the story and the process in recreating this beer from its original recipe with use of the original yeast. The story starts with the discovery of 134 years old beers in the cellars of @carlsberg @carlsbergdanmark in Valby, Denmark. The original yeast in the bottles was recovered, and this is used in this new release. Great story👍🍺🇩🇰 #carlsberg #carlsberg1883 #darklager #rebrew #yeast #valby #denmark #kjøbenhavn #probably
