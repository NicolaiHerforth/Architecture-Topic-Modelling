Listen to your body. üëêüèº @Regrann from @saligdig - SALIG JUL OG KALENDERGAVER #23 
Chiropractor and yoga teacher, Dr.@Alicia Thomsen explains: Our bodies are continuously communicating with us. Not through words but rather through discomfort or pain. If we choose to listen, symptoms can become a gift. They just arrive in funny wrapping paper. By listening to the language of the body, we can begin to connect with a wisdom or intelligence that resides in each and every one of us.  This language is gently directing us towards what we need to learn and the style of care that‚Äôs needed in order to heal.

In December you can purchase a package of 3 sessions with Alicia for 1995 DKK. This can be used for a treatment or 1:1 session. Regular value is 2400 DKK.
