#Dreaming of this bowl of #porridge right now from the fantastic #Grod in #Copenhagen. 
Grod is a porridge bar with various locations including the indoor #Torvehallerne Market where I had mine. The market in general is a must try. 
I had the bowl with all the toppings, around 15 in total, including peanut butter, cocoa nibs, coconut and apple compote. It shouldn't work but it was wonderful.
