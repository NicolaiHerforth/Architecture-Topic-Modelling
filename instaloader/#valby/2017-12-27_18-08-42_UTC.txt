These days I am getting ready for 2018 and actually really looking forward to this year! Lots of good things are coming my way and I feel this will be my year. 
January is time for moving to my new apartment and the start of @wonderwomencph bootcamps on 9/1-18 and 23/1-18 with my colleague @gintaregil 😍🙌🏻

Never ever give up on your dreams. Work hard, believe in yourself and be positive. Things will go your way if you believe and put time and effort into it every single day! Never settle for less than you deserve and dream about ❤️💎⭐️
