Tribute to the can!
This day we'll focus on beers in cans.
We all want them, they are lighter to carry and the can is the perfect canvas for all the creative people, who put alot of effort into the design of the beer label.
The line up so far is:
Zipper - collab between @lervigbeer and @stigbergetsbryggeri 
Coffee Barbary Coast - @almanacbeer 
Raspberry Blush - @mikkellersd 
Beer Geek Breakfast - @mikkellersd 
Brunch Of Nuts - @mikkellersd 
Stay tuned......there might be more cans added to the list.
