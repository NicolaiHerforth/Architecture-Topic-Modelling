So far, I’ve only tried two types of #kilns: Top-loading kilns and front-loading kilns. I didn’t think I would prefer one over the other, but I find myself loving the front-load kilns more than the top-loaders. Front-load kilns, such as the ones in this picture, are far better insulated. They cool that much slower due to the more efficient heat retention, and I think that makes a huge difference in the end. For now, I’m not doing a lot of production work, which means I can start with the relatively inexpensive top-loading kilns. But, I can see myself going into production in the future, and when that happens I will definitely get these. Or should I be hardcore and get trolley kilns? HMmm.
