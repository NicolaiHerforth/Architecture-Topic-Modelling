A small fraction of gluten-free pre-orders being picked up today from Feelgood Bakery ↪️THIS IS HOW YOU ORDER ↩️ Every Thursday from 4pm until Tuesday morning at 8am the webshop is open for ordering fresh baked goods. You then pick up your bag Thursday between 12-18 at Feelgood Bakery. The webshop www.feelgoodbakery.dk also has a selection of mix based on what we use at the bakery 🍞🍰 We ship the mix to all over Denmark. Ps. We always have fresh baked gluten-free goodies on the counter for the spontaneous Pssst! The crocheted sign on the wall says 'STRAIGHTEN YOUR BACK' (a good reminder in general, a very good reminder for a baker lady 💃) #feelgoodbakery #microbakery #denmark #bread #nørrebro #naturallyglutenfree #bakery #glutenfree #glutenfri #wheatfree #copenhagen #howto #christmas #baker #backproblems #busybusybusy #nordicglutenfree
