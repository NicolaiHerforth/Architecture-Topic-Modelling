The architecture of the Maersk Tower is based on an idea of creating communities – between researchers, students and the city. The Maersk Tower – with its 3,000 copper shutters and relief-like expression, state-of-the-art research facilities and inviting campus park - serves to open the university towards the local area in a beautifully designed and varied green urban space. info by maeraktower.ku.dk
