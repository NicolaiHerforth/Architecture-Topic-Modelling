This is just my kind of Sunday! Started out with oatmeal and a nice, slow run on Kalvebod Fælled with my coach ❤️ 🏃🏼‍♀️😊 After training we melted (and tasted) chocolate and are now ready for family dinner and presents 😃 Merry #Christmas 🎄🎅🏻 #run #runner #running #runnerslife #runninggirl #runnersofinstagram #løb #træning #løberliv #københavn #Amager #copenhagen
