I was starving by the time I left the gym and met up with @anna.toby and @frusilva  I am so glad that we decided to check out @hookedkbh GUYS! It is actually the best Fish â€˜nâ€™ Chips Iâ€™ve had in Copenhagen and quite possibly, ever... Outside of the quality and attention to flavors what you truly taste is the love that the guys put into it. If you like food and are looking for a super cozy spot to add to your list. Do yourself a favor and get @hookedkbh (bring some friends, orgasms are best when shared with others) ðŸ˜‰ #eatlocal #nÃ¸rrebro
