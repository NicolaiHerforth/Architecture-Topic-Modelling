The Super Dog from Pølse Kompagniet...two organic sausages, roasted potatoes, pesto, and some sort of secret sauce. I stopped at both the Papirøen (Paper Island...a food hall housed in what used to be a paper plant) AND the Torvehallerne locations. Apparently, I should have added bacon and Parmesan, but I didn't realize it until it was too late.
