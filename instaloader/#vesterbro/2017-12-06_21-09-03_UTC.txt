One of the things we like best about Copenhagen is its very vibrant organic food scene. On this occasion, we would like to thank @mirabelle_cph for the delicious sourdough bread and @baestcph for the very tasty, locally-sourced bites at our opening party. We highly recommend their Christmas and New Year's Eve lunches #qwstionstorecopenhagen #buylessbutbetter  Photography: @play_hunter
