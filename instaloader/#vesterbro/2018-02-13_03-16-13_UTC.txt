Vestre Kirkegård. Hidden inside bushes and trees, you’ll find this statue of a kneeling, mourning woman from the early 1900s. Classical Greek style. There are no statues of mourning men before mid 1900s, before those times, men showing feelings was considered a sign of weakness. Another experiment with photo taken pre-dusk on a rainy day, to trigger the flash.  #kirkegård #Vesterbro #cemetery #graveyard_freaks #aj_graveyards #EtoE_2 #gravkunst #københavn #copenhagen #skulptur #mourningwoman #sculpture #vestrekirkegård #Vesterbro #cemetery #friedhof #monument #peacefulplace #citywalk #graveyard_freaks #danskerneshistorie #total_denmark #aokdk #visitcopenhagen #visitdenmark #igerscopenhagen #cphpicks #mitkbh #canonphotography #MoodyGrams #opdagdanmark
