Zero Waste Spices ♻

As I'm trying to eliminate plastic and packaging from my life, I e.g. buy zero waste and organic spices from @asa_spice. I just bring my old and reusable spice jars and other small food jars, and fill them up instead of buying spices in ordinary supermarkets with unnecessary packaging 👍
