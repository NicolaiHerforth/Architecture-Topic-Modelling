This house, Bjerregårdsvej 16A caught my eyes: It was quite out of context. And I was right! The house was moved here 2009 from Østerport Station. It was built in 1905 as the chandlershop “Uncle Tom’s Cabin”, or “Dragon House”. When the railroad expanded, it was planned to be torn down, but was moved to this private garden in Valby. #Bjerregårdsvej #Valby #ØsterportStation #arkitektur #architecture #architecturelovers #københavn #copenhagen #aokdk #visitcopenhagen #igerscopenhagen #cphpicks #mitkbh  #nofilter #udenfilter #loves_united_copenhagen #tipkbh #canonphotography #nofilter #udenfilter #såharjegsetdetmed  #hey_ihadtosnapthat #delditkøbenhavn #halftimbered #bindingsværk #bygningskultur #steampunkhouse
