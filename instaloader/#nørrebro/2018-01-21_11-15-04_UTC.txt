Momma is often taking me for walks on the local cemetary #assistenskirkegård Now I guess some of you are thinking ‘walks on the cemetary 🤔’ but this cemetary is as much a park as it is a cemetary and the locals are even having picnics here in the summertime ☀️. I love this peaceful place in the middle af the city and there are a lot of trees 🌳 and flowers 🌺 for me to sniff. A lot of famous Danish writers fx. #hcandersen 👆🏻, artists etc. are buried here so I lot of tourists come for walks as well. Check it out if you are ever in #copenhagen you might run into me 👍🏻 #bertha #beagle #beagles #instabeagle #nørrebro
