Another @airbnb win. A cabin in the garden of a small community in a gorgeous park in Copenhagen. The sort of place where they don't lock doors and have outside showers. Less than Â£30 a night. Sun streaming through the windows. And it comes with a bike to get around the city. Delighted with this find! #Copenhagen #Valby #Denmark
