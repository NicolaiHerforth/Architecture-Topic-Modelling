We are celebrating TWO awesome months here in Valby!!! Hurray to that 💚🌱🙏🏽
.
And with the best way we can, we are giving back to the community by partnering with Kilden / Incita - a local non-profit, sell their locally produced Honey, shoe polish and plants. 
Incita is helping people, who suffered from brain damage due to accidents, live a fruitful life. 
We love to stand together with community. That's one of our values. 
So, here's some excitement - that you will dropby here and buy their products -  and pure happiness that we can help!
