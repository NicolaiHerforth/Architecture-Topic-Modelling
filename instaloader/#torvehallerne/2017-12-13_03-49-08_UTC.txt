Copenhagen's popular market place Torvehallerne is the best place to look for Danish delicacies, local vegetables, fresh fish, or maybe some Italian specialities. Torvehallerne were designed by architect Hans Hagens and opened in September 2011.

One of the key points of Torvehallerne is that they specialise in selling some of the freshest products that aren’t often found in ‘run-of-the-mill’  markets. One of the best surprises about Torvehallerne is that it actually has two main halls specialising in different types groceries, small restaurants, take out places, kitchen knickknacks or the most precious of nectars - wine!
