What to drink for Christmas? Its always the question! @johannduedahl a partner in @ancestralebar choose this. Rosé from the south of France as a after dinner refreshment. Close by it's Tom Lubbe's coume de lolla, fresh vibrant red for "flæskesteg" and then a unicorn wine from Austria that shows a lot of emotion - rot from Gut Oggau #ancestralebar #vesterbro #wineshop #vinvivant #vinnaturel #winebar #christmaswine
