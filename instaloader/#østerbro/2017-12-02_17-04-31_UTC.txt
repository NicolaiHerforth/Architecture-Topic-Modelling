The tree where I live and have lived now for more than 30 years fills an important space in this urban area and for me personally.
It has many functions in reminding me about time and the seasons and the importance of slowing down once in a while.

Our city has unfortunately seen a great loss of old big trees during the last 20 years. 
Many due to sickness. 
But luckily because of the awareness of the importance of nature in urban environments there has also been added so many new green areas. Here the coming generations will have the pleasure of seeing trees grow big and old.
