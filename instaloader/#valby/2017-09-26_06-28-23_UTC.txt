Goodmorning everyone! 
Ever heard of camu camu? Most people haven't, but actually this little cherry sized berry grows in the Amazon region in South America and is known to be rich in C-vitamin and in some cases has been measured to have 60-times more than a regular orange! Quite fascinating 😱
The taste could remind us of acidic fruits like lime or lemon. 
Here @cafeonthe6 we will be serving a new type of smoothie the next week, where we will include 100 grams of frozen camu camu pulp blended with a little water and 100 grams of mango pulp. This will definitely energize you on this rather grey day 😊 hopefully we will see you here soon! ❤️
