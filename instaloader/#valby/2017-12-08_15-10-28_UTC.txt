Grønne Hjem (1950). Peter Bangs Vej 267. Horticulture started when this part of Copenhagen still was countryside by gardener Verner Nielsen who at that time worked at Assistens Cemetery. He was also a communist, according to their website! After his death, the wife, later his daughter and granddaughter continued it. In 1990, it changed name from Ålholm Planteskole to Grønne Hjem (Green Homes). Personally, I bought a lot of plants (and a birdbath) for our small garden in Husum, and still love to visit it.
