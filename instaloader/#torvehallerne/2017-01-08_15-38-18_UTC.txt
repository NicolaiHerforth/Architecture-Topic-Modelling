You can't go to Copenhagen without having smørrebrød - not that you can see the bread! A very full and very delicious open sandwich from @hallernes 💚🍞🐷🥓 🌱 (inside an amazing food market where we spent a looong time) 😍
• roast pork and crispy bacon with pickled onions, mayonnaise and leaves on rye bread •
