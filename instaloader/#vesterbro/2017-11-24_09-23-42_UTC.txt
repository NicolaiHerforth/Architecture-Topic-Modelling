HuskMitNavn at Glyptoteket!
A visit to a museum is a logical approach to looking at both art and other human beings - and the similarity is sometimes pretty striking. 
Through his humorous drawings, the Danish artist HuskMitNavn has depicted the Glyptotek’s diverse public. ‪On 7th December‬ we pay tribute to our visitors with an invitation to the preview and launch of the book VISITORS, which brings all these drawings together. See the whole programme and find out more about the project here.
