____________________________________________________. ✨ 10 TIPS IN 10 DAYS, DAY 6 - COSTAL COPENHAGEN✨ .

Why live close to the water if you don’t go explore the coastal areas? Today’s tip might be more of a summer tip, but it can definitely also work in the winter! 🌊🏊‍♀️⛄️.

One of the routes I like the most around Copenhagen is to go up the coast and all the way up to Dragør, a rather small harbor city that just oozes summer-vibe (mainly in the summer, naturally). ☀️🏖 First you encounter the Amager beach area, that also in the winter is super fun to bike around with its small and winding bike paths along the water. Next, you get to this place, the snail I would call it. It’s such a cool structure that is used as a diving and swimming facility in the summer (or in the winter for the super hardcore!) Next, you reach the @cph_airport where you can go plane-spotting, which I actually think is quite undervalued! 🛫🔭
