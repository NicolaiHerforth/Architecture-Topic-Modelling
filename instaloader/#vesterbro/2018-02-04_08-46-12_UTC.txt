Hej Copenhagen!
Yesterday we had a nice day strolling around, greeted by snow & smell of drunk Danes enjoying bottomless brunches. We said we will go to the city every saturday and just fill our day with all kinds of acitivities. Yesterday we saw “I, Tonya” and it was very good - I recommend it. We ate a delicious japanese style chicken burger at Ibu and d(r)owned on Gin & Tonics. Eventually wrapped everything up with a very strange pizza at Tivoli foodcourt.
Today is a day to relax and do something creative indoors. Are you enjoying your weekend? 😘
