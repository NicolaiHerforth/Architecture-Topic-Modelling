Morning masa ready to go :)) From day ONE, all our corn comes from 5 communities in Oaxaca, Mexico 🇲🇽 🙌🏼. We receive it in whole kernels. We cook it and stone grind it DAILY to make the freshest TORTILLAS possible. It’s the base for a great TACO. We wouldn’t have it any other way 👊🏼#hijadesanchez #copenhagen #oaxaca #vesterbro #kødbyen #torvehallerne
