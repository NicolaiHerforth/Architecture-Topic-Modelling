Another fun packed day in Copenhagen! The zoo is so well laid out it makes you feel as though you are amongst the animals. Seeing a polar bear was a massive tick for me ğŸ˜Š. We then visited #torvehallerne market and drank fresh juice before experiencing the enchanting Tivoli Gardens. It first opened in 1843 yet looked brand new and carried more charm than any amusement park I've ever been too. #copenhagen #denmark #zoo #tivoli #polarbear #easterholidays #kÃ¸benhavn #awesome
