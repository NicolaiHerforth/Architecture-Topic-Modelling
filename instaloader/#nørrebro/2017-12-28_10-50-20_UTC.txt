This quiet time between Christmas and New Yearâ€™s Eve is exactly what I needed to slow everything down, to just be in the moment. New ideas have more room to grow and I can nurture them a bit more. Hope youâ€™re having having some good moments as well in these peculiar days that are the last remnants of a year gone byðŸŒ—
