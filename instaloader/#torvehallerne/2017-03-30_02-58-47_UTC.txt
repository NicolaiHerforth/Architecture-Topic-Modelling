We hit the biggest beer bars in Copenhagen, so now it's time to see what else is out there. Bootleggers is in the perfect place. Just off of Torvehallerne, which is where the Mikkeller bottle shop is, it's surrounded by amazing food vendors. We head to the basement dwellings and try Siren Brewing Ryseing Tides and Schlenkerla Rauchbier.
