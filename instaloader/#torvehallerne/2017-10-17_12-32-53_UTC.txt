Open-faced sandwiches are a staple of the Danish. Copenhagen being geographically surrounded by water, fresh seafood is inevitable. Here in their modernized glasshouse food market, one may find an assortment of these sandwiches, locally known as Smorrebrod. In addition, there’s an array of fresh fruit and vegetables in their farmers’ market section. Great day to spend a Sunday. Always experiencing the local activities to absorb their lifestyle. #torvehallernemarket #torvehallerne #torvehallernekøbenhavn #glasshousemarket #copenhagen #copenhagenglassmarket #copenhageneats #danisheats #smorrebrod #openfacesandwiches #danishfarmersmarket #danishfood #foodie #foodieeats #freshseafood #salmon #smokedsalmon #smokedsalmonsandwich #shrimp #shrimpsandwich #freshherbs #copenhagenlocaleats #mealbythehour
