So, there is this rum company @treshombres.rum that sail around the world and buy rum on a bad ass (almost) pirate ship! Using only the wind and a few strong sailors to power across the Atlantic. We got some rum from Marie-Galante, Barbados, Dominican republic & the Canary islands! #treshombresrum #fairtransport #pirateship #shoppencph #liquorstore #n√∏rrebro
