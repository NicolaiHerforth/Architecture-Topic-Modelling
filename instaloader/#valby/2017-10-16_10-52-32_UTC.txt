Due to retarded Open Gym hours at my local box (and my neighbours not being cool with me deadlifting in the evening in my home gym 😎), I did an outside workout instead with my #roguefitness 32kg Kettlebell and my @rxsmartgear jump rope and jump mat.

15RFT of:
35 DU
1 kettlebell power snatch (from the ground)
1 kettlebell Turkish Get Down (Alternating arms each round)

18:46.
