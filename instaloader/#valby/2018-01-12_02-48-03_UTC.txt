Jesuskirken (1891, the separate tower, 1895). There are many photos of this church, this angle is scarcely used because it is only possible on a clear winter’s days. Designed by Vilhelm Dahlerup, financed by brewer Jacobsen, and inspired by ancient Italian cathedrals. The church got quite a few unusual decorations, like pentagrams, Zodiac symbols, and unlike most Danish churches, it is directed north-south (usually east-west). #Valby #Jesuskirken #church #kirke #arkitektur #architecture #architecturelovers #bygningskultur #bygningshistorie #danskerneshistorie #total_denmark #igersdenmark #københavn #copenhagen #aokdk #visitcopenhagen #visitdenmark #igerscopenhagen #cphpicks #mitkbh #canonphotography #nofilter #udenfilter  #citylife #loves_united_copenhagen @CopenhagenHeat #tipkbh #myplanet_facades #archi_focus_on #voreskbh) #vilhelmdahlerup
