When I first moved to Copenhagen, Slagtergårdene in Vesterbro was one of my favorite neighborhoods in town, and it still is. Just passing by on a bike, one feels the history kept in these buildings, a piece of vibrant cultural heritage, interesting, intriguing and important in so many ways. Now, they are threatened to be demolished by bulldozers, and once they are gone, there is no way to press ctrl z - Slagtergårdene in Vesterbro will be erased from the map and from our collective memory. Join in for the demonstration this Saturday - it is our last chance to save this amazing place ❤️ (pictures from Copenhagen Museum) #slagtergårdene #vesterbro #vesterbrokulturarv #københavn #culturalheritage #culturalhistory
