Today we had students from DIS to discuss our work at Impact Roasters and educate them about the process of coffee production in Ethiopia. It’s been an interactive gathering where students could ask questions and participate in the roasting process.
If this is something your school, company or institution can benefit from please send us an e-mail at info@impactroasters.dk
