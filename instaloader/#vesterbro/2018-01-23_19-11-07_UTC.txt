Just before Christmas I #restored this #chandelier for a customer. As a gift for his girlfriend 💃🏻 Usually I'm not so fond of restoring chandeliers, but his cause was too sweet. I couldnt say no 🍼 It came out pretty well? 👉🏼 Just contact me if you have a #vintagelamp in need of love ❤️ #vintageshop #vesterbro #copenhagen 👉🏼 #worldwideshipping at a #fairprice 💥
