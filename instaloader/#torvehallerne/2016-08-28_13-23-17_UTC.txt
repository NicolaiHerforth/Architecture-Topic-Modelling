Can't believe I'll be going into my 4th week back into uni tomorrow üò© wish I was still travelling round Europe trying various delicacies! If you ever go to Copenhagen be sure to go to Torvehallerne food market. It's not so much a market as lots of pop-up awesome eateries! Probably the tastiest and most reasonably priced food #torvehallerne #torvehallernekbh #k√∏benhavn #copenhagen #denmark #food #market #foodporn #sm√∂rrebr√∂d #smorgasburg #sandwiches #travel #tbloggers #holidays #–∫–æ–ø–µ–Ω–≥–∞–≥–µ–Ω #–µ–≤—Ä–æ–ø–∞ #–¥–∞–Ω–∏—è #–µ–¥–∞ #–±—É—Ç–µ—Ä–±—Ä–æ–¥ #–∫–∞—Ñ–µ #–ª–µ—Ç–æ #–æ—Ç–¥—ã—Ö #–ø—É—Ç–∏—à–µ—Å—Ç–≤–∏–µ
