Dragged Mrs Grizzly across the other side of town (after handing back the rental bikes, obviously) to check out @bruscph, the trendy NÃ¸rrebro brewpub from @toolbeer
.
For us beer geeks, this place is pure bliss. 32 taps of rotating beers brewed freshly on site to To Ã˜l standards. Voted Denmarkâ€™s best new brewer in 2018 by @ratebeer, as well as the countryâ€™s best brewer tap room
.
Not only are the beers incredible (pics to follow), but the fermented fries with mushroom mayo were hands down the best chips Iâ€™ve EVER eaten ðŸ¤¤ðŸ¤¤ðŸ¤¤
.
I expect weâ€™ll hear much more from BRUS - theyâ€™re basically just producing to sell within the brewpub at the moment but are setting up a canning line and I for one would love to see their beers canned and sold across Denmark and further afield!
