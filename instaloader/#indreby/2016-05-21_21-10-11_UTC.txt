🍕🍕🍕🍕 The review has tried PS Bar and Grill. They serve several things, amongst them three pizze. All are with some form of pork meat. This is the Pancetta, but without the pancetta. Left was mushrooms, mozzarella, chili and fresh sage. The flavours were great together. Sage added great taste. The chili was abit redundant. It did not add spice. The crust was sadly not very good. Too dry on the edges. The review would have added a slice had it not been for the overall horrible service we got. #pizza #pizzareview #restaurant #psbarandgrill #copenhagen #københavn #psbarkøbenhavn #indreby #pilestræde12
