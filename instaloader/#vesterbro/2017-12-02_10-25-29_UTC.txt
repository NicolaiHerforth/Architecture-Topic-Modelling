IN THE SHADE OF THE PALM-TREES. When Carl Jacobsen built Glyptoteket, his aim was to lure people in by means of the exotic palm-trees in the Winter Garden in the hope that this might awaken the visitors’ interest in art. 100 years on, it continues to perform just as it was intended. . ‪On 7th December‬ you’ll have the opportunity to see all of HuskMitNavn’s drawings for HuskMitNavn på Glyptoteket: Preview and book-launch
