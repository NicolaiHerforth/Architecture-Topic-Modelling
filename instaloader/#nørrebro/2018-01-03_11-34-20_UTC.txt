Happy new year 🎊🎈🎆... We have a tradition of taken a photo every hour New Year’s Eve. As always when the last hours of the year are running out and the new one begins the smiles and laughs are getting bigger. How is that for a firework? As the new year is settling in the guests disappear from my camera lens and head out to begin their new and promising year 🤗🍾💃🎈🎆❤️🙏🍸 #nørrebro #newyearseve #2018 #friends #lovedones #traditions #everyhouronthehour #happynewyear #highhopes #bigsmiles #bringiton
