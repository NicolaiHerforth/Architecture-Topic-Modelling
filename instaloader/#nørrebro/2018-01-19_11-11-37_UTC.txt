My new favorite brunch spot in Copenhagen: @kalasetcafe 🌟❤️🍳🥐🥑🍓☕️
.
Yesterday I tried their new menu -now with the classical format of brunches in Copenhagen where you select the items you will like to have- and I was beyond impressed with both the flavors and presentation
.
On the photo you’ll see scrambled eggs, avocado with red beet hummus, fresh fruit topped off with syrup and lemon zest, goat cheese au gratin with nuts and figs compote, chia pudding, banana bread with banana sauce, and a wide range of creative and delicious treats.
I gotta say that everything was on point and I could tell that they are choosing carefully their ingredients.
The coffee is also a strong point on their brunch offer and you will also find some other hot and cold beverages, juices and even alcoholic drinks if you feel adventurous
.
The service is incredibly friendly -something I always enjoy and appreciate- and the crowd is a mix of laid back locals and visitors that just wanna chill and have a good time.
Unpretentious and cozy place with great food, I’d move in right away if I could...
Mange tak for a super brunch my friends, keep it up 🌟
