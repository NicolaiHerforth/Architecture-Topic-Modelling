What did you do this Sunday for a bit of TLC?

I also just realised I’ve said TLC in my classes for quite some time now here in Copenhagen, and a Danish student asked me recently ‘what does TLC mean’... I’m such a dummy!
🤦🏽‍♀️
Tender Loving Care!! #selfcare on Sunday is literally the best. More time spent cooking and consuming the creations, face masks, snacks, catch ups on the phone with loved ones!
I’ve booked myself in for a workshop (such a treat... I always forget to actually go to other workshops) this evening at @theyogaflat with Binne Dansby called Body, Breath & Spirit.
Yes yes a thousand times yes 🤙🏽
Love u
