Good morning Copenhagen. 
Torvehallerne is a buzzing food hall smack-bang in the city centre of Copenhagen. Close to the busy Nørreport Street and the pristine lakes, it’s the perfect place where you can grab a handful of delicious treats to watch the sun go down on popular Dronning Louises Bridge.

Torvehallerne is not a supermarket - it is a super market. At this beautiful food market, you will find over 60 stands selling everything from fresh fish and meat to gourmet chocolate and exotic spices, as well as small places where you can have a quick bite to eat.
