Nice one! Classic Imperial Stout from one of my favourites, danish Amager, in a collab with Barrier Brewing, Oceanside NY.
There are a few things that Amager are excellent at; IPAs of any style or kind, and Imp Stouts.
This is quite roasted with a lot of bitter coffee, liquorice, dark chocolate, caramel and small vanilla hints. Medium body. Big sweetness in aroma, but not as much in taste. 
Overall, very enjoyable and robust üç∫‚úä #beerlovin #polarstrutsen #amagerbryghus #amager #kastrup #denmark #danmark #themortician #imperialstout #beer #beerporn #craftbeer #instabeer #beergasm #hantverks√∂l #√∂l #beernerd #beergeek #hophead #americancraftbeer #cannedbeer #hantverks√∂l
