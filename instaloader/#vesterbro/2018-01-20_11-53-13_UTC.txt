When you want a REAL tasty frank in Copenhagen, go visit John’s Hotdog Deli, next to the central train station, across from @tivolicph ! This bacon-wrapped piece of heaven is made from  coarsly ground free-range pork and subtle spices. Veeery good. Also, John makes his own mustards - they’re worth a visit on their own! #takformad #pølseisvøb #frankfurter #copenhagen #københavn #vesterbro #hovedbanen #bacon #baconwrapped #aebmb
