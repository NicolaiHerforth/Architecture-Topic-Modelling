Last day in Copenhagen today and it's a special one! ✨We are celebrating the birthday of my baby sister, who is turning 21 and will forever be my baby sister no matter how old she gets 💕🎉The sun is shining for her & I couldn't be more excited to spend the whole day with her ☀️I hope you are all having an amazing day!
