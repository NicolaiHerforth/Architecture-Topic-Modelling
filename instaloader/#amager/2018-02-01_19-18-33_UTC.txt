I do love a good Amager beer and especially their imperial stouts. 
Dario the Dark Don | 10% 
This is a rich roasty slick beast of a stout. It’s so smooth with beautiful roasted malt aromas and flavours. There’s notes a plenty of liquorice, cocoa and coffee too which gives a lovely natural mild bitterness. Wonderful, as always from Amager.
