Had a rough day today. One of our horses fell in a deep ditch near the stable. The rider went to the E.R. and is ok. It took 3 hours to get the poor mare up, she had just givin up and did not fight at all. Everybody gave their everything and we finally got her up. She’s now in the stable and seems to be ok. Thanks to all. #amager #amar #kongelunden #dragør #taarnby #frieslandsvej #horse #accident #ditch #standtogether #helpeachother
