Smørrebrød - Hallernes Smørrebrød - Smørrebrød, the famous open faced Danish sandwich, over the coming weeks I’ll share a series on smorrebrod to try and capture the variets across Denmark.The Smorrebrod (meaning butter and bread in Danish), consists of a piece of Rye bread, which has been buttered, with Palaeg (topping) placed on the top. The Palaeg often includes, meat, eggs or fish. Pictured is a fried mackerel, with Hollandaise and cold roast pork, with red cabbage. #smørrebrød #sandwich #porks #fish #foodstyling #denmark #copenhagen #opensandwich #torvehallerne #food #foodphoto #foodstagram #hygge #baconrollsetcdk #baconrollsetc
