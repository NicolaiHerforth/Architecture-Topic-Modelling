2017 was one big challenge for me. I got my first work experience, graduated and moved back to Denmark where I found my second home. 
I was called lucky a few times and I believe that I truly was. I am glad for both the good and bad moments that shaped me into a more grateful person.
Good luck in 2018, everyone! ðŸ’™
