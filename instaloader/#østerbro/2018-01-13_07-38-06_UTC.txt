On our POP-UP BRUNCH MENU that is available on Sundays all through January in Østerbro, we serve this little avocado toast. Originally the idea comes from the other side of the world; according to The Washington Post, it was believed that chef Bill Granger, based in Sydney, Australia, may have been the first person to put avocado toast on his café menu in 1993. We’ve added a Danish/Japanese touch to ours by serving it on toasted rye bread with a bit of salty seaweed added.
