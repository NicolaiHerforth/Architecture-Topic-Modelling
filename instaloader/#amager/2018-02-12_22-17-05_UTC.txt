Holy sh*t this is tasty!
"Cody the Crooked Cop" an Old Ale by one of my favourites, Amager Bryghus.
Really dark, almost classic Porter in colour. Lovely aroma of dark dried fruits, figs, raisins, cereal grains, chocolate, toffee, small coffee note and a whiff of liquorice. Imagine a massive classic English Old Ale, but with a proper body to it. Heavy, robust, flavorful. Caramelly and malty, but not overly sweet. Tiiiny hint of booze breaking through at 9,5% ABV. It stays balanced, and I'm really impressed with the body and mouthfeel of it. Some oats in the mix always helps. Freakin love it! Give me more!

Amager in my heart!
