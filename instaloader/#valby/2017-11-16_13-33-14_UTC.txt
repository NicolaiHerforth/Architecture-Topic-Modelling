Happy #socialenterpriseday! 
At Impact Roasters, we take part in the campaign #kÃ¸bsocialt, and would like to share our story about the journey we take to create the impact in the coffee world. 
We stand for ethical and sustainable coffee trade, and we care for the well-being of the coffee farmers communities that grow the coffee we produce. By buying our products and getting our services, you support various Impact Projects that we run in Ethiopia to bring change to the local communities. You also help to create a meaningful relationship between coffee farmers, coffee consumers, and coffee producers. Together we drive a more sustainable trade model and think about coffee beyond the daily cup ðŸ˜Š
