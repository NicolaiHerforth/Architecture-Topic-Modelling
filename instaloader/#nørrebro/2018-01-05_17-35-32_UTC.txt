Nørrebro elevated railway station - The tation was built in 1930. It was designed by DSB's chief architect K.T. Seest. The three-storey functionalist building has barrel vaulting above the tracks at first- and second-floor height. The station stands where the elevated railway runs above Nørrebrogade. The elevated railway was built in 1925-30 to replace a large number of level crossings on busy urban streets. During its first years, the railway ran small petrol-driven multiple units from Hellerup through Vanløse to Frederiksberg and back. Since 1934, S-trains have been running along this line, which now goes from Hellerup to Ny Ellebjerg stations. Nørrebro Station was listed in 1992. #architecture #functionalism #barrelvault #railway #railwaystation #trainstation #train #stog #nørrebrostation #nørrebro #listed #fredet #igersdenmark #igerscopenhagen #loves_united_denmark #typicalscandinavia #iamnordic #commute #travel #ktseest #dsb #dsbstationer #københavn #copenhagen #ibyen #kigopkbh #sharingcph
