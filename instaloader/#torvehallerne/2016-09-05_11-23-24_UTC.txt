Linkwood 1989, Lovely!! Super fine single malt whisky. Never heard of Linkwood before, but this first meeting was absolutely impressive. In spite of its rather higher alcohol degree as 52.8%, the base is so smooth and sugary with the hind of aromatic grain.. Medium body with a bit of floral flavour and fresh greenish touch. The perfect complexity!! are the words for this baby.
