Love a good old fruit and food market. I think it's pretty clear I love my food, especially if they come round (like cakes or tarts) or donut shape.. hmm why didn't I find a donut here? ðŸ¤”
sorry the caption doesn't really fit the photo, the lemons got me thinking about lemon meringue tarts and somehow led to donuts. 
I just wanted to say I like visiting the markets here ðŸ˜¬
