Sometimes when you’re traveling you get into uncomfortable situations that can change your point of view or open your eyes to something about yourself or something entirely new. Today I had one of these situations and I’m thankful how it turned out. I took some little ceramic pieces in case I had to say thank you, I think I’m going to use them tomorrow. #thankful #tourist #newexperiences #handmade #pottery #ceramics #vase #stoneware #natural #clay #håndlaget #keramik #nørrebro #københavn #copenhagen #denmark
