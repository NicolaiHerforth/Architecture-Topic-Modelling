I love local markets!!! And this is a great one! You can see in each one what are the ingredients that every culture eats more! They are a social and cultural experience. The colors, smells and architecture, they are all different and interesting! In the next days you will see a series of pictures of my visits to 4 different local markets in 4 different cities! This is the first i visited #torvehallerne #copenhagen #localmarkets #fruitmarket #foodphoto #foodphotography #foodphotographer #foodstyling #rubarb #carciofi #alcachofas #freshproduce #nordicstyle #nordiclight #traveler #naturallight #stylist #foodstylist #canon #artichokes
