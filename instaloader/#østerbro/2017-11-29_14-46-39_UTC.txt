Let's dance in style, let's dance for a while
Heaven can wait we're only watching the skies
Hoping for the best, but expecting the worst
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?
.
Let us die young or let us live forever
We don't have the power, but we never say never
Sitting in a sandpit, life is a short trip
The music's for the sad man
.
Can you imagine when this race is won?
Turn our golden the faces into the sun
Praising our leaders, we're getting in tune
The music's played by the, the madman
.
Forever young
I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, and ever
.
Forever young
I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever young
.
Some are like water, some are like the heat
Some are a melody and some are the beat
Sooner or later they all will be gone
Why don't they stay young?
.
It's so hard to get old without a cause
I don't want to perish like a fading horse
Youth's like diamonds in the sun,
And diamonds are forever
.
So many adventures given up today
So many songs we forgot to play
So many dreams swinging out of the blue
Oh let it come true
.
Forever young
I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever
Forever, and ever?
.
Forever young
I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever
Forever, and ever?
.
Forever young
I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever ♥️
