We really did have THE best time in #Copenhagen where the mini me surprised me once again with her utter fearlessness, this time on ice skates!

If you’re thinking of going and taking kids I wrote a review after our earlier visit in May - link is in my bio let me know what you think #adventures #travels #travellingwithkids #travelswithatoddler #travelswithkids #travellingwithafouryearold #kidsofinstagram #copenhagen #hugge #torvehallerne #familyadventures #globetrotting #letthembelittle #letsgolittles
