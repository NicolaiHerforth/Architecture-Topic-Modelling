Every time, we get to the construction site, it looks less under construction 😊🙏🏻 Last time it was the windows, that made my heart beat faster 🙃Today I was especially happy about a peek at the new wooden floor 💗✨ Can’t wait to bike here every morning and smell fresh bread, snurre, rolls, croissants and coffee! Then see, what’s on the menu for lunch, check in with @miedp @stigibjensen @sonjaebock in the kitchen, watch @malenefiskerpalm make some beautiful cakes and check the daily schedule with @_nnesofie and upcoming classes and events with @trinehahnemann So so happy and excited to be part of this new project and #team 💗🙏🏻✨ #østerbro #copenhagen #2018 #newproject #food #foodculture
