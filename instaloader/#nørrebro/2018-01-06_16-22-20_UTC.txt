Super excited to see our latest piece taking its final form. The two benches have been made of square beams of birch plywood jointed together. On the sides of the beams we have glued sheets of Danish linoleum. The wool that we chose for upholstery comes from New Zealand sheep and has 60.000 Martindale cycles making it ideal for public usage. The marquetry is made from birch, mahogany and walnut veneer. For finishing we have used a water-based clear semi matte lacquer for the exposed parts of birch plywood, sunflower oil for buffing up the linoleum and a clear linseed oil for the marquetry.
