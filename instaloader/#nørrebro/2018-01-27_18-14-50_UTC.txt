Beginning to wrap my head around this “hygge” sensation. Stumbled across @plantpowerfood_cph in #nørrebro this evening whilst feeling cold and a bit grumpy, and now I feel absolutely bloody fantastic again: warm, cosy and content. I’m also currently running on pure sweet potato power.

Seriously though, this dinner was probably one of the best (if not the best) veggie meal out I’ve ever eaten. It was essentially ‘just’ a jacket potato but damn the guys here know how to do something special with their ‘taters! Absolutely divine 🌱 #kylietravelsin2018
