Have you ever been on Amager? If yes, then you probably noticed that it's always windy there. This makes it perfect for Kitesurfing! Kitesurfing enthusiasts are surfing all year round and it can be an incredibly nice view from the beach (det kan vÃ¦re et utrolig flot syn fra strandkanten). So grab your bikes and enjoy some fresh air. ğŸ¤—
