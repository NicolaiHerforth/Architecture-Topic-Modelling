La boca is back! 
As most of you know, we decided to close our grill bar at the Westmarket location at the end of last year, and after careful consideration we are now very happy to announce that we are taking over the kitchen at P2 by Malbeck, our sister bar in N√∏rrebro. The cuisine will more or less be the same as what you know from Westmarket, creative and spontaneous Argentine and Spanish influenced snacks, small plates, cheeses and hams. 
Already from tomorrow, Friday the 19, you can come by and enjoy our cuisine once again,... and don't worry, our chorip√°n, oysters, the La boca tatar and our fat juicy ribeye will always be on the card.
Can't wait to see you all again.

Love the La boca team
