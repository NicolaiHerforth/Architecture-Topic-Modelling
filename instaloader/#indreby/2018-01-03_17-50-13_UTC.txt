A postal card from yesterday’s photo walk in Copenhagen ❤️🇩🇰
I started my day at @madogkaffe having brunch with a couple of fellow foodies that I met through Instagram (how cool is that 😌). A thousand photos later I proceeded to one of my favorite solo hang-out spots and coffee bars @prologcoffeebar.
Right after I found myself at the terrace of Hotel Danmark sipping on a dark cold beer and contemplating the city from above completely alone with the sun warming up my face and nostalgic thoughts.
Of course I got hungry at some point so I walked around the inner city trying to figure out where to munch down my savage appetite.
I stopped at this plaza to shot the people passing by and the pretty colorful buildings.
I ended at @muslingbistro enjoying some nice seafood and local beers, sitting by the window and watching life pass by, wondering when will the day come that I don’t have to leave...
Anyway, dreams and goals -specially when they seem so far away- are what keep me so alive.
I will see you soon Copenhagen. Happy 2018 everybody 🙋🏽‍♂️😌
