Cooking Time!
.
I was unsupervised at Torvehallerne, a foodmarket down town, and all the lovely colors drew me in.
.
I got one of each - almost. And I knew exactly what to make with each vegetable.
.
I carried it all home - and the excitement must have worn me out because I unpacked and had a 1.5 hour nap.
.
We ended up having pancakes for dinner!
.
But tomorrow I am ready!
