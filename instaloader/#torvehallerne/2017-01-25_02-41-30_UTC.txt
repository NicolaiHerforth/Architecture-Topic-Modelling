This is a dish I call "Copenhagen Chicken" because I stole it from one of the stalls in #torvehallerne when I was living there. It's a one-pot roast with chicken, spicy Italian sausage, zucchini, tomato, red pepper, olives, lemon, chunks of crusty bread, onion, and of course garlic. #cook90 #onepotmeal
