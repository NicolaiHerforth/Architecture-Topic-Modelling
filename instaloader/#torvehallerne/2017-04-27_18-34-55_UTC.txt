🇩🇰I'm not usually one much for motivational quotes, but I can't help but feel that Hans Christian Anderson was right on this one. Spotted on a spice stall at the wonderful Torvellerne food market (thanks @sisi_orr for the recommendation 🙏🏻). We've only got 8 full days left until we fly home, and at times I've felt a bit out of my depth, but these two months have contained some of the best moments of my life. 🙌🏻
