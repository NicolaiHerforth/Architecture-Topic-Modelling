Mandarina Man, India Pale Ale 7% Amager Bryghus Kastrup Denmark in collaboration Wicked Weed Brewing Asheville NC USA.

I think when posting a collaboration beer like this one it is hardly to escape the discussion about the biggest devil within the beer world mf AB Shitbev #fuckem some fall for their green selling out.. so in this review i just stick to reviewing the beer. Which i my statement and you know at the same time my point of view i guess.
One thing i wonder though if this collaboration was done before or after the news came out?
Ok.. back to the beer.
The beer a ipa.. is indeed very fruity (Amager calls is it a tropical fruity ipa) 
Loads of tropical fruit, orange and citrus. There is a little sour note in the finish which under lines the fruity part.
Nice beer Amager!
3.75*
Cheers!
