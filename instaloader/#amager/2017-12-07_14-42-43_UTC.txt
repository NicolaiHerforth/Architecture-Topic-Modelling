Defensive Lineman Allan Sandborg is returning to Amager Demons after a short stint at Copenhagen Tomahawks. Allan will be a great addition to the defense, and also to the coaching staff, where his knowledge and experience on the defensive line will help improve players in years to come. We are thrilled to see such a player return to the club ðŸ˜ƒ #amagerdemons #daff #football #demonsfootball #godemons #amager #tÃ¥rnby #amerikanskfodbold ðŸ“¸ by @1stdownphoto @amagerbladet
