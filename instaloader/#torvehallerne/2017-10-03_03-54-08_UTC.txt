My trip ended but the pictures haven't!! So they say when the lights come on in Copenhagen your bike lights should come on too. A front and rear are required in Copenhagen. Get a bike--get outside. You can take it on the transit system there. I did a boat, trains, metro, bike, and plane. This Friday I have even MORE pictures coming as I will be doing my first ever Instagram takeover of @rriveterbags! .
