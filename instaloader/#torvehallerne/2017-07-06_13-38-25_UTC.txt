A perfect day in #copenhagen. The requisite #nyvahn photo op, view from our hotel of the man made lake for sunbathers, boating, sup, kayaking and swimming. taking the boat tour of the canals, biking around town with my #thai #danish niece as over 50% of the people here do, and snacking at #torvehallerne. #smörrebröd #fishmarket #passionpassport #sas #directflight #travelgram
