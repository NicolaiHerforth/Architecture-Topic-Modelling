It Finally happened. Walking down my neighborhood I saw her on the window of Second Beat. My Olivetti Valentine.
I've been drooling over this typewriter for a long while but wanted her to have a Danish keyboard as my other ones I use frequently have the English or Spanish one.

Soo here she is, dressed in red and oh so pretty. Thank you Kim Madsen for the birthday gift, now you know how I spent it :). Also featured, the poetry book Rystet Spejl by Søren Ulrik Thomsen, a gift from @endnuenvinther next on my reading list... And the awesome photography book 2200 which features images by Thomas  Christensen and my dear @zarko_ivetic of characters and places of the lovely Nørrebro I am so happy to be living in.

What a lucky gal. Thanks guys.
