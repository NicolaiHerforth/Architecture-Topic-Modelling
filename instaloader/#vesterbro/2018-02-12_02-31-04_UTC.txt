Vestre Kirkegård. Everybody knows the beloved statue of The Little Mermaid, icon of Copenhagen and Denmark. Fewer know that it was inspired by French sculptor Henri Chapu, a few knows that maybe with the dancer Ellen Price was the model. And even fewer might know the tomb of its maker, Edvard Christian Johannes Eriksen (1876-1959), who did better statues than the mermaid, but none of them known worldwide as the Mermaid. He made this statue upon the grave of his wife and himself. Photo taken pre-dusk on a rainy day, to trigger the flash.
