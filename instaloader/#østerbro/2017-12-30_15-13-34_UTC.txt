Looking back - in 2017 I also did this 200 meter long mural at the lakes in central Copenhagen 🌊🐟. I wanted to show the hidden nature of the city - which in this case is the different species of fish in the lakes. Video by @troels_heien of Monoline.

This project was kindly supported by Metroselskabet and Østerbro Lokaludvalg. Thanks.
