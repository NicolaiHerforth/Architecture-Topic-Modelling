🍰🍰 VEGAN CAKE // Still dreaming of this super super delicious vegan cheese I had for my birthday back in November, made by the very creative chef @vegan_chef_neel @plantpowerfood_cph . Everybody loved it! I really recommend anyone wanting to have a delicious quality plant based deserts to try it out, regardless if you are vegan or not. You can also check out their Christmas catering menu if you are lazy: www.plantfoodcatering.dk
Thank you Neel 🙏🏼❤️🌱✨
