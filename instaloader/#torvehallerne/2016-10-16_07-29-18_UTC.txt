Yesterday I went out to @torvehallernekbh and the city to take a stroll on my own. Was in a boored mood. Did buy myself some Korean pears, a book, and some fresh farmers market cherry tomatoes. For dinner I indulged a thin, crisp pizza from @gormspizza and when I got home I made a tomato/mozzarella/basil salad with a drizzle of olive oil and pepper. So yummy! ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜˜ #tomat #salat #tomato #salad #mozzarella #pizza #hawaii #torvehallerne #kÃ¸benhavn #copenhagen #buyingstuff #koreanpear #farmersmarket #cherrytomatoes #outonmyown #udeformigselv #strollingthecity #gÃ¥turibyen #indulge #nydelse #gormspizza #everyday #mylife
