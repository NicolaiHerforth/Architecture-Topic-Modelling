I know a lot of you will think this does not belong at a brewery IG account but I honestly don't care. Today marks the 16th anniversary of #chuckschuldiner 's passing, leader of legendary #death and #controldenied . My colleagues might not care but I cannot work a shift without music and I don't think I can assemble a playlist that doesn't have any of his bands in it. Before there was beer, there was music in my life and if I have to choose between having good hearing or a good liver in my final years, I'll pick a death with a soundtrack for sure. Music probably is the answer to all of life's unanswered questions and not having it is too unbearable of a thought. And to top this off, #warreldane from beautiful #sanctuary and #nevermore passed in my home country of Brazil earlier today, making December 13th a shit day for basically any metalhead out there. I wanted to pay my respects to these beautiful musicians, both gone too soon. Today I'll be raising my #amager glass in their honor.
