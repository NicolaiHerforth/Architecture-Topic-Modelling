Fun fact about the place we call home: Built in 1917, this former spirits warehouse turned office space was proclaimed to be the tallest highrise in the Nordics coming in at an impressive 10 floors and 11,500 m2. Back in the day, whole lorries could enter the building via elevators and drive around indoors!
