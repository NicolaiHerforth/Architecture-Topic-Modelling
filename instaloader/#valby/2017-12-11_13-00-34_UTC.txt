I am enjoying a really great cup of cafe latte here at #impactroasters.
Its a newly open fair trade coffee shop at #langgadestation.
The coffee is from #ethiopia and its wonderful. The best coffee I've had for a very long time. Definitely worth a detour :) #coffee #ethiopiancoffee #fairtrade #coffeeshop #copenhagen #elskditvalby #valby
