Cafe Ellebo, Sjælør Blvd. 49 (1941) is not really a cafe, rather a “favorite bar” for the locals, with billard and jukebox. Small, cosy, clean, nice and cheap beers. Classical music, Kim Larsen ... What many considers a typical Sydhavns-bar with roots back to the 1940’s, support for the local footbool club FREM (1886), now added the flavour from young students. Just recently, the "Tuborgmanden" has been replaced by a seated woman to the left of the door - the bricks still bear marks of that. And hey! All delivered by local Sjøbeck Øl & Vand.  #valby #Sydhavnen #værtshus #localbar #total_denmark  #københavn #copenhagen #danskerneshistorie #københavn #copenhagen #aokdk #visitcopenhagen #igerscopenhagen #cphpicks #mitkbh  #nofilter #udenfilter #loves_united_copenhagen #tipkbh #facadefortællinger
