Mikkeller Haven brewed by De Proefbrouwerij. Copenhagen, Denmark. (Brewery is located in Belgium. Quiet weird ingo found on net). This beer I found at beer shop at Torvehallerne in Copenhagen. Beer looks like something local but if it is? I'm not sure about it.

Golden-orange color pilsner. Aroma and flavour quiet hoppy and  sweet with bit of flower touch. Medium carbonation and bitterness. Very easy to drink. 
Aroma 6.5/10
Taste 6.5/10
Can 0.5 L
Alcohol 4.6%
Price 30 DKK (4 euro) - not sure about correct price.
