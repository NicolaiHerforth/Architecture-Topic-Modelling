Kongelunden part 2 - The birdlife in the Grove is varied, with over 300 species. During the migration season, bird watchers flock to Amager from all over Copenhagen. There is a bird-watching tower in the southern part of the Grove – with any luck, you’ll spot cranes and large birds of prey in the air. Not to mention the occasional jumbo jet, as the airport is close by. If you like pheasants, send a kind thought to these woods, as this is where the colourful birds first bred successfully in Denmark. Most of the Danish pheasant population can be traced to the breeding stock brought here from Asia in the 1800s by Master of the Royal Hunt Baron Løvenskjold. #amager  #govisitdenmark #visitamager #typicalscandinavia #thebestofscandinavia #iamnordic #igers_denmark #igers_copenhagen #loves_denmark #sharingcph #delditkbh #kigopkbh #voreskbh #loves_united_copenhagen #loves_denmark #grove #lake  #trees #forrest #nature #natur #efterår #autumn #sas #aircraft #tv2vejret #kongelunden #kingsgrove #skov #visitcopenhagen
