❤️🎄December 17th🎄❤️
17th day of my positivity advent calendar. Would love it if you’d join in in the comments - see explanation below and previous posts 😊 Today I took my guitar out of its case for the first time in... I don’t know how long. I haven’t really played it for years. But it’s the perfect time a year to take it out of its case, because my guitar actually smells like Christmas! 😁🎄✨ For some reason it smells like a mix of gingerbread cookies and playdough 😜 And yes, I’ve had others confirm this, LOL! 🤣 I’m self-taught and not a fantastic guitar player, but I play well enough for little hygge sessions of singing and playing at home 😊 Would love to take some guitar lessons at some point - maybe I should do something about it in the new year? 🤔 I also need to pick up singing again ☺️🎶 Happy 3rd Sunday of Advent! 🙋🏻🎄🎅🏻✨

I’m “hosting” a little positivity advent calendar here on Instagram 😃 Every day until Christmas, I’ll post a photo (in the afternoon/evening CET) and in the caption I’ll share something positive from my day. And I hope that some of you guys would join me by leaving a comment about something positive from YOUR day? 😊 It could be anything. Something that made you smile or laugh, something you're grateful for, something or someone that made your day - you name it. It’s all about collecting good thoughts and experiences, and by sharing them with each other, I’m sure we’ll get into the Christmas spirit 🎄❤️✨ What do you say? 😊
