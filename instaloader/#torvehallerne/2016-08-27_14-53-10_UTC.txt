Favorite place in #Copenhagen so far = Torvehallerne Market. Seriously a Fit Foodie DREAM. It's an indoor/outdoor market where you can get specialty items, meat/fish, produce, fresh bread/pastries, etc. It's open every day...and we'll definitely be back! Since @DaFunkShow and I are spending a full 4 days here, we picked up 2 bottles of wine, a loaf of fresh bread, cheese, eggs, potatoes, an onion, berries, and some bananas (all the breakfast essentials)! #FitFoodieTravels #Denmark #ActiveTravel #Berries #FarmersMarket #Torvehallerne
