1. Places to visit in Denmark. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
- Copenhagen! It is the most amazing city. Especially the part of Copenhagen called Vesterbrø. Lonely planet actually wrote an article about Vesterbrø and called it one of the most coolest places. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
2. Activities doing in Denmark. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
- I would recommend people to visit Copenhagen. There are a lot of opportunities to see museums and stuff like that. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
- If you are looking for a more local experience I would recommend to visit the Sunday flea-markets. For example ‘Vera’s [photo 2] or ‘Rita’s blå lopper’. There is this special vibe and an urban atmosphere. Plus it is a great possibility to go shopping. ⠀
- I would also recommend people to visit Christiania. This is a city within the city Copenhagen. Try to Google it!! ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
3. Restaurants in Copenhagen ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
- I would recommend ‘absalon kirken’ [photo 3]. It is very bohemian and also not expensive. Also a great place to bring your kids. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
