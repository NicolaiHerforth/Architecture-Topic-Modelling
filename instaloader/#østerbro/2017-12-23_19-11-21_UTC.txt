Earlier today we visited Victor Borges Plads to see the statue of the Danish comedian, musician and national treasure Victor Borge. Given the time of year, a small Christmas tree shop had sprung up around him. He doesnâ€™t normally hold that measuring stick, and they kindly removed it so I could take another picture without. A twoderfully kind thing to do five me, as the great man might have said.
