There are many names for following a pathway bigger than yourself. Ikigai, sense, purpose, raison d'Ãªtre - no matter what you call it, you know it when you are doing it. You miss it when you are not. Let intuition serve you, and listen across all feelings. And remember, you are never alone. Good morning.
