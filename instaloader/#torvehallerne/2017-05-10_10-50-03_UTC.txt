Streets is talking! | Word on the street is, that you can taste a plethora of delicious well crafted Greek wines when @oinofilia pops it up at Torve Hallerne during May in Copenhagen - it's through Oionofilia that I first had an encounter with Hatzidakis wines before I visited the winery on Santorini and had an engaging tour with their agronomist when I got to see some of the wine making processes at first hand | Also, yet another song  reference, Just Blaaaaaaze | #torvehallerne #copenhagen #wine #popup #hatzidakis #santorini #aidani #wineacids #graffiti #photography #organic #jayz #justblaze #streetsistalking
