I can't say enough great things about the Torvehallerne here. One building is mostly sweets and the other building is savory. It started raining this morning and this was a perfect way to start it with my $8 breakfast at Granny's House. This is a Hanekam aka a "cocks comb". It's a Danish type of pastry with an almond filling and hazelnuts on the top. Basically = amazing. The pastries and croissants I have had here have topped Paris by a long shot. And it's right up there with Italy. .
