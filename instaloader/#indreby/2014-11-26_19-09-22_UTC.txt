Så er vinterens første workshop JUHHUUU...
❄️❄️❄️❄️❄️❄️❄️❄️❄️❄️
Partner Workshop v/ @olgaordeig ✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨
Partner Yoga is a FUN yoga practice that will help you deepen both your poses and your relationships. By holding onto another person, you can balance better than you could on your own, move into poses more deeply, and hold them longer, which increases strengthening and stretching!
👯👯👯👯👯👯👯👯👯👯👯👯👯During the 3h workshop, we will explore different yoga poses in partners as well as strengthening and acrobatic exercises.  We will finish the workshop with a short Thai Yoga massage session to restore and balance the body’s energy system.  It is going to be so much fun! J
