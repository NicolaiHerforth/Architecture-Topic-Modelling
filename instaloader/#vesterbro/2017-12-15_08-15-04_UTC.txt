And that's a wrap! We closed down @vesscph last night and the gallery is now back to normal.

The previous months and week alone have been amazing and it was so humbling to have so many people stop by on the opening night and over the week to show support and love. I especially appreciate the people who kept pushing me along the way to get my thesis and exhibition done on within 2 months (hi dad & @m.eckbertson & @ronnie_valentine ❤️) And yes ❤️ @streetcolors for modeling in the sweet pic.

Big up to all the amazing brands that supported the opening @normanncph @decideretcider @copenhagendistillery @girlsareawesome @lowficoncerts & @fritzkola 
And lastly available still pictures that haven't been sold will go on the web shop later on today at some point
