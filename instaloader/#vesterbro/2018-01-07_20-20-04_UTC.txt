Skyline Lost tee - a Street Movement x primus architects collab 👕👍🏽
.
BACKGROUND STORY: This tee illustration is created by our good friend and talented architect and artist, David Bülow (aka @bulow_ink), of @primus_arkitekter. We first met David and the gang when we did the Carlsberg project together around 2010-11 - a project best known for ‘Rail Heaven’ throughout the parkour community. We’ve shared office space since then - even through our recent office move and address change ❤️
.
Recently primus fought a valiant battle to protect the cultural heritage and diversity of a special area in Vesterbro, Copenhagen, known as ‘The Butcher Yards’. With official city plans already on the table, primus decided to present an intriguing, nuanced and empathetic alternative solution. An alternative that, in stead of going down the same old developer road towards social and architectural gentrification, met the official requirements while still preserving the cultural traces and diversity of the area. Sadly, despite gaining a lot of traction with the public as well as many industry professionals and institutions, the idea fell to a lack of political will. Thus yet another unique and historic neighborhood will soon be wiped off the map… 😢
.
During the process David did this sketch of The Butcher Yards skyline. We liked the drawing and had so much respect for the incredible effort, that we decided to ask David if we could put it on a t-shirt - and here it is, part of our ‘Support your local artist’ series ✍🏼👌🏽

Like the political guts and ambition, the ‘Skyline Lost’ tee is available in very limited quantities from our web shop. Check it out via link in bio ☝🏾 and go support our good friends at primus architects!
