More Carlsberg - probably the oldest arse-grabbing in town... (pic. 3) 
Carlsberg City District is a small area in Vesterbro in Copenhagen, bordering to the Frederiksberg and Valby districts. The area is named after Carlsberg's beer, which was brewed on the premises from 1847 - 2008. However the visitor centre Visit Carlsberg and Jacobsen House Brewery, which produces special brews, are still located here.

The Carlsberg grounds are currently being transformed into a new, but historic, neighbourhood called Carlsberg City District and is welcoming new tennants like educational instiutions, shops, caf√©s and its very own S-train station: Carlsberg Station.
