Finally ticked this off my Things-to-Eat-in-Copenhagen list. ‚ò∫Ô∏è Ma Poule's @mapoule_cph classic duck sandwich is simplicity at its best. A Crusty/Chewy baguette with mustard, Roquette leaves and a generous portion of shredded Confit Duck. So delicious! üòç #ChouxPastryLove #MaPoule #Torvehallerne #ConfitDuck #DuckSandwich #Awesomeness #Copenhagen
