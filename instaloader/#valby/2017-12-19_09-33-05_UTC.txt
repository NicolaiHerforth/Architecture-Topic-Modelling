Christmas Basket â€“ Coffee leaf tea
---------------------
Coffee leaf tea is not just an ordinary tea but a smooth and lightly sweet taste drink packed with anti-oxidants and anti-inflammatory substances. Even though the drink is made from the coffee plant leaves, it has very little caffeine. The tea has been consumed for hundreds of years in Ethiopia for its high health benefits.

The tea is part of our Christmas Basket, but it can also be purchased separately at our roastery and coffee shop at Langgade st.
