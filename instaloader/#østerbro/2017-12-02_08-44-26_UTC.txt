Saturday morning walking in #østerbro discovering #brumleby, this #beautiful example of #socialhousing born just outside #copenhagen 's #walls, after #choleraoutbreak in 1853 in #overpopulated #downtown killing thousands of #people. The #danish #medicalassociation wanted this #project and #architect #bindesbøll was commissioned to #design the #houses.
