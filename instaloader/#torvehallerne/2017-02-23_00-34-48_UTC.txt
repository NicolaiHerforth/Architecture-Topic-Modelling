One of my favourite cities in Europe, Copenhagen. Visit one of the best food markets in the world, Torvehallerne where you'll find incredible seafood, coffee, craft beer and pretty much everything else you'll ever want to eat or drink. @norwegianairlinesofficial sometimes offers flights out of NYC for $300. There's no excuse not to go! #copenhagen #torvehallerne #europe #foodmarket
