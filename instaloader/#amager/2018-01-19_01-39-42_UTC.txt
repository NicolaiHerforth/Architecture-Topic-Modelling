Forever humbled and grateful

Ã˜resundskollegiet 
KÃ¸benhavn, Amager, Danmark
2015.01.18

3 years ago today I landed in Copenhagen and embarked on one of the biggest life altering experiences of my life. This city stole my heart and the building of Ã˜resundskollegiet (shown here) nurtured me through Danish culture and enthusiasm. 2 years later when I landed back in this beautifully intelligent city, I was welcomed by dozens of amazing friendships I had created in my time there. These people have welcomed me, loved me, and challenged me in all the things I thought I knew about the world, life, and myself.

It had been a long and complicated journey to even have this opportunity. I was fortunate enough to get a massive scholarship that paid for my housing, flights, and more. But the truth was that I would not have even received this scholarship if I didn't get the opportunity to continue my studies,

It is no secret that I bit off more than what I could chew by going to a private school. And for that, I had to make countless sacrifices and work my ass off. It still wasn't enough at the end of my sophomore year, where I was short on tuition for the next year and would not be allowed to return. At this point, I already had my scholarship for study abroad, but couldn't do so without attending my school. 
What happened next was remarkable. After a recommendation to tell my story on social media and start a gofundme page, people came from all over to contribute to my effort to continue school. It didn't reach the full amount I needed, but with all the effort I had made and how well i had done at USF, my school decided to sponsor the rest and allow me back. 
I now have spent an accumulated 9 months in Copenhagen and almost a year abroad. This wouldn't have been made possible without the countless love, guidance, and even financial support I received during college. I think about you all every single day and am eternally grateful. 
As I work towards my year or so abroad, I am overwhelmed with appreciation to all that helped to be where I am today, to be on the path that i am, and to be the man I am today (imperfections and all). ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡°
