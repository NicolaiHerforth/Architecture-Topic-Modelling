Torvehallerne on itself. "It is not a supermarket – it is a super market." We strongly agree with the above statement. The array of fresh produce, street food and jovial souls on display is quite astounding. @hallernes smørrebrød was quite the spectacle and we dearly miss those open face hunks of heaven. This little sneaklet consisted of beef, shavings of horseradish (Fuck yea) pickles, crispy onions and some unidentified naughtiness lurking beneath. Cba with you London pal, you're just not the same. 
Price: don't care
