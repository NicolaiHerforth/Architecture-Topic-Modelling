Everything comes to an end. This has been my drawing corner for the last several months. Its been in the back of an abandoned greenmarket. The room happened to be the refridgerator. Its been an amazing time there, and a lot of crazy ideas has been planted, and are still growing on full speed. Thank you for all of this! #art #friendzone #magic #valby #groenttorvet #kultur #culture #drawing #black #white #christmas #follow4follow #instapic #adventure #travel #projects #comics #desc #work #live #dontdreamitbeit #copenhagen
