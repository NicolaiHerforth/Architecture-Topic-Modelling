Today I want to send special holiday thanks and a shout out to Coffee Collective in Torvehallerne!
From the girl that took my order that didn’t quite speak Danish (much to my joy as I wasn’t quite sure how to ask in Danish to please grind my beans for a French Press), the other girl that started my hand brew although her shift was over, to the guy that sent her home and took over my order, talked to me about this new coffee that I had ordered and then gave me a taste of their filter coffee of the day so I could really feel and taste the difference between them! It is clear that these people enjoy their work, and as a customer, this is the reason I decided to make this post to say THANK YOU for being awesome, why I keep coming back and make everyone that comes visit me taste their coffee, because, let’s be honest, they have the best coffee in Copenhagen!
