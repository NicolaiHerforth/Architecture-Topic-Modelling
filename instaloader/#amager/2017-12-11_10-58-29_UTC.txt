Coastline.
Copenhagen, Denmark.

Surrounded by the sea, Denmark has a long stretch of coastlines all over the country. The sea is so accessible and so connected to the Danes since ancient times. The calm and quiet sea is really soothing the senses, although the strong wind at the moment would probably numb them instead. As they say around here, there is nothing called a bad weather, just bad clothing.
