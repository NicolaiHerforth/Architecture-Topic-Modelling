'Bout a week ago I was travelling back from Copenhagen with a bronze medal round my neck thanks to the dedication and devotion from the best athletes I know. GB men and women both returned home with a European bronze and I am so blessed and grateful to have been given this opportunity. I could not thank the hosts, team, staff or supporters more for making this experience one I will cherish forever and never forget. (The multiple breakdowns were worth it in the end 😂) until next time, team manager out. 🇬🇧🥉🏆🏈
