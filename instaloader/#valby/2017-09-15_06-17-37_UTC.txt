Back in business @ @crossfitcph #bazaren during my second session of today.

I've only been to Bazaren for #Bazzerne training since May. But now the limitations in my home gym (mainly the Danish autumn weather and rain messing with my ability to do weightlifting outside lately :D) is forcing me back in the box.

I celebrated it with a 6kg PR Jerk @106kg/234lbs. Easily and finally. I've been stuck at 100kg for weeks and weeks. Almost had 111kg/245lb - so I'm hopeful about hitting my 118kg/260lbs (in the C&J obviously, but the clean part isn't the problem ;)) goal before the Open.
