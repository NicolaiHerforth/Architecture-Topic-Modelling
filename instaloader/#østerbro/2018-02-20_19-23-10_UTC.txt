Did you know that we have bamboo toothbrushes at our store? It is one of the smart ways to use less plastic in your life. Bamboo is completely biodegradable so what you can do is to pull out nylon bristles and compost bamboo part. It completely decomposes in 6months. 
Our brushes are from HYDROFILL (@wasserneutral ) and they are one of our best sellers 👌👍. Come and check them out. You can also order online 😉 #bambootoothbrush #copenhagen #hydrophil #zerowaste #zerowastehome #vegan #østerbro #sustainableliving #holisticliving #bethechange #saveourplanet
