“The Prism” is a multisport arena by Dorte Mandrup Architects from 2006. The arena is covered in a translucent material that provides a natural light source to the interior and gives the building a glowing impression on the outside after sunset – consequently the name: The Prism (or Prismen in danish). The opalescent panels look rather dull from the outside during the daytime, though. The facilities and the aesthetics of the interior are, however, nothing short of a miracle as you can see for yourself in these pictures. #prismen #holmbladsgade #dortemandrup #dortemandruparkitekter #amager #københavn #sportsarena #sportarchitecture #architecturehunter #architectura #architettura #arkitektur #architectureilike #architecturelove #architecturelovers #architecturelove #architecturelover #architectureporn #architecturedesign #architecturephotography #architecturephotographer #architecturalphotography #wonderlustcopenhagen #delditkbh @dorte_mandrup @bloxkbh #modernarchitecture #contemporaryarchitecture @prismen
