Major throwback to 2011 when I visited Copenhagen for a few days. My friend asked for some tips for CPH but since I hadn't been in such a long time, I didn't feel comfortable suggesting places as they may be totally crap now and/or have shut down. So, I went on a Google rampage and pulled a list together (like I normally would whenever I go on holiday) of places I'd like to stay, eat (most important üòÅ), get lashed and grab some culture. Having done this list, I am now majorly craving a revisit to Copenhagen, mostly because the restaurant scene seems so insanely amazing. Beyond Geranium and Noma, there seems to be a whole stable of exciting eateries with talented chefs, working both in the fine dining world and street food scene, many  of whom are alumini of Ren√© Redzepi, like girl boss Rosio Sanchez, his ex Pastry chef - who went off to create her own taqueria, so the Danes could experience proper tacos - err body deserves tacos afterall - basic human right if you ask me. Full deets live on the blog and there's a map üó∫ too. Also, if anyone has their own tips, please do share!
