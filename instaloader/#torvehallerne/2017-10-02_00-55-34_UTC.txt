My trusty Essen Toulouse steed was turned in today after several great days of bike riding. So much better riding here than Newport for sure (especially after a kid was hit last Monday in front of my house). Despite the fact I lost the key lock in Malmo, Sweden...well, at least the bike was at the Norreport Station...because if that was reversed well yikes. Definitely take advantage of @flynorwegian flights and I plan on adding to the AllYawl blog here soon in regards to some Denmark tips that weren't out there. (Also for Norwegian and navigating dirt cheap flights. ðŸ˜‰)
