The other day I saw a documentary about a band called 'Ukendt kunstner'//'Unknown artist', I went to high school with one of them, and one of their songs resonated with me and made me want to draw this. The text says: painting the town red with my broken heart, and the picture is a part of Copenhagen with neon lights and lakes. Thought it was quite fitting, even though I liked it better before I coloured it. Maybe it's just not finished. #drawing #art #copenhagen #københavn #inspiration #song #irma #søerne #indreby #colourful #copic #markers #copicmarkers #copicmultiliner #indianink #ink #sketchbook
