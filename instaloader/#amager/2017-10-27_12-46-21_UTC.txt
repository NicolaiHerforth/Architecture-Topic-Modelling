Kongelunden part 3 - Today the King’s Grove is a favourite destination for riders, joggers, nature-lovers and, in particular, people interested in insects. It is also a good place to pick berries, herbs and mushrooms,  as well as wild garlic in the spring – just follow the scent.

The King’s Grove is also the metropolitan area’s only west-facing beach. Kite-surfers are particularly fond of the south-west point – on a good day, with the wind in the right direction, they gather in their hundreds. #amager  #govisitdenmark #visitamager #typicalscandinavia #thebestofscandinavia #iamnordic #igers_denmark #igers_copenhagen #loves_denmark #sharingcph #delditkbh #kigopkbh #voreskbh #trees #loves_united_copenhagen #loves_denmark #grove #horse #horseriding #trees #forrest #nature #natur #efterår #autumn #tv2vejret #kongelunden #kingsgrove #visitcopenhagen #loves_nature #hest #ridning
