Denmark on a plate right there 😍 The famous danish "smørrebrød" is definitely a must-try while in Denmark. Rye bread with loads of varieties when it comes to toppings. Here is one with roastbeef and the other with chicken salad and bacon - including all the trimmings 🥓🍗🍅 The wonderful, locally brewed Mikkeller beer is of course a perfect match 🍺 The place is Torvehallerne, Copenhagen 😃👍
