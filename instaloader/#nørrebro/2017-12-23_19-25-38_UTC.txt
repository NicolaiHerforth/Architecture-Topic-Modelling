#lambic santa has some last minute presents for you waiting in our fridges, we're closed tomorrow but open tonight until 2am! Here's what we recommend for pairing with a Danish Christmas meal: Fantôme Saison for the potatoes, Mikkeller/Boon oude geuze, aged in calvados barrels to give apple notes that go with the pork, #decam oude geuze, high acidity to cut through the fatty duck, and finally a #driefonteinen Oude Kriek, tart cherry and marzipan flavours will complement the famous risalamande perfectly. God Jul everyone, see you tonight or on the 26th 🎄🍾🍷#geuze #mikkeller #nørrebro #øl
