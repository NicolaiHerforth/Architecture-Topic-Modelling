I dragged my boyfriend out on a walk today! Wind was blowing like crazy and it was very cold! Also I didn't have the right footwear to go of road, as I prefer.. But I'm a crime rider and went of road anyways. My feet are very cold and wet, but it was worth it. I'm so glad we made it outside on this beautiful Sunday! And thanks to my boyfriend for putting up with me❤️😅#amager #amagerfælled #nature #happy #love #coolwindinmyhair #sundayvibez #sunday #walking #copenhagen #blueskies #yetcloudy #stormy
