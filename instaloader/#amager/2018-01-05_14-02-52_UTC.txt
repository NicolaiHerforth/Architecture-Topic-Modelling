200kg Hip Thrusts for sets of 10. Working my way up to a triple body weight working weight. 40kg more to go!

The Hip Thrust is one of my favorite exercises to train the posterior chain without putting too much pressure on my lower back, as it tends to get overworked quickly.

One thing I commonly see people doing wrong in the gym when performing this exercise is overarching back over the bench. Just try to keep your shoulders/upper back stable, chin tucked and bring your hips to the same height as your chest without rolling your shoulders back over that bench, as if you were trying to look what's happening in the gym behind you.
