Here is a more detailed behind-the-scenes photo of how we make a quick and easy salad. All you need is a large bowl in which to toss each ingredient. Remember to always wash your veggies! First, we tossed fresh spinach leaves, then we added cherry tomatoes cut in half, chopped cucumber, red onions, oregano, salt, freshly squeezed lemon juice and olive oil. Mix everything carefully as the spinach leaves get crushed easily and you would want to keep the crunchy taste. Enjoy!
