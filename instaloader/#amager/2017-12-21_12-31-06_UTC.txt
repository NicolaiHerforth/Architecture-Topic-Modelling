Linda - The Axe Grinder, Barleywine / Red IPA 9% Amager Bryghus Kastrup Denmark.

This beer can be seen as the follow up of Amagers release "Todd - The Axe Man" which was a collaboration with Surly Brewing from Minneapolis. Beside a collab also a tribute to it's founder and head brewer Todd Haug. But.. Surly is not only Todd Haug, his wife Linda does not stand behind him, but they are running and brewing side by side.
This way Amager collabed with Linda and this leaded to Linda The Axe Grinder which
is also a tribute to her.
The beer is a crossover of a Barleywine and a Red IPA which has been oak aged.
The mouthfeel is quite thick and creamy.
In flavor it's quite sweet, with stong vanilla notes and the hops provide a tropical fruit
pineapple and citrus flavor and end to a bitter finish.
With it's 9% abv it's quite a powerful beer, and it took me a while to finish the 500 ml
bottle specialy because i had in mind to share it with Monika and she said she wasn't up for a beer when i had opened the bottle already.
Anway a quite sweet but powerful collab from Amager and Linda from Surly
4.00*
Cheers!
