The Cobber Tower by Arkitema Architects from 2004 at the entry to the harbour of Copenhagen. The facade is still in delicious chocolately cobber colours, but will eventually turn green as the process of verdigris sets in. The building is the headquarter of the law firm, Plesner. #kobbertårnet #plesnerlawfirm #arkitema #arkitemaarchitects #østerbro @plesnerlawfirm @arkitema #architecture #architizer #architecture_hunter #architectura #architettura #arkitektur #danskarkitektur #danisharchitecture #cobber #architecturephotography #architecturalphotography #architecturelovers #architectureporn #architects #architectur #architecturelover #architecturestudents #architecturestudents #arch_more #archilovers #modernarchitecture #newarchitecture #chocolate
