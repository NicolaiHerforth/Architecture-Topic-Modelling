Championship of Copenhagen was a big thing back in the early 80es. But to smoke 'The Beef' Michael Markussen was even bigger, Veggerby 3rd and Frost 4th. Markussen later became World Champ point race, Frost olympic champ and world champ in Point race, Veggerby world champ in Stayer.. life ain't always fucking fair, cos I was never World Champ, but heyyy once I was Champ of Cooenhagen ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ #amager #texaco @jens.veggerby
