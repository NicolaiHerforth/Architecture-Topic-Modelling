My favourite #rooftop in the city, #Østergro!
Tonight they served five different "#æbleskiver" 3 salty and 2 sweet ones.
Traditionally we eat them sweet with jam and powdered sugar, a traditional winter and #Christmas sweet.
 But this place loves to mix things up!
So we got the salty ones with #veal, #seaweed &#roe and #pork, and the sweet ones with #seabuckthorn and the last with #rhubarb.
