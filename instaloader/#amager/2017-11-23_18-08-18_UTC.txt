Throwback to my summer 2016 trip to...the Caribbean! Only joking! This is the sea at Amager Strand near the Danish city of Copenhagen 😳🇩🇰⛵️ It was a stunning sight to behold and a real surprise. With a view out to the Øresund Bridge and planes landing at the city's airport this was a great spot to rest after an energetic bike ride from the city 😀🚲 #Travel #Traveller #Copenhagen #Denmark #Danish #Amager #TBT #ThrowbackThursday #Hygge #Europe #Sail #Boat #Yacht #Blue #Turquoise #Beach #WindFarm #Malmo #Sweden #Kobenhavn #Sverige
