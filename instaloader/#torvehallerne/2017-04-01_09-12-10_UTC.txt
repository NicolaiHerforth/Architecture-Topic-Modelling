It's our first morning in Copenhagen and our flat is 2 minutes from Torvehallerne - the most incredible market selling delicious foods and drink. Today for breakfast we had a blueberry, mint and ginger juice from @palaeoprimalgastronomi and a chia pudding with almond milk, hazelnuts, raspberries and dark chocolate chips from @groedcph! 😍
