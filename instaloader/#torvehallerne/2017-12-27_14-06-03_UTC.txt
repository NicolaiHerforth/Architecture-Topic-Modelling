We started our Christmas excursion with a stop at Slurp Ramen Joint. The ramen is good and the staff is friendly.  Next we headed to the walking/shopping street Strøget via the incredible food market Torvehallerne for last minute shopping. Strøget was awash with Christmas lights, music, plenty of shops and the smell of candied almonds wafting through the air. For a quick warm up we stopped at the Glühwein hut for a cup of mulled wine with your choice of a shot of rum or Amaretto. When we were all shopped out, we ended our day with jazz at Charlie Scott's Jazz Bar. Not a bad way to spend the final days of the season.
