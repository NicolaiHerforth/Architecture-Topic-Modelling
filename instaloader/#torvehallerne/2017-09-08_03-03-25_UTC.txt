Copenhageners love their gr√∏d, or porridge. So much so that inside of the Torvehallerne market (where you can find amazing artisanal local foods), they have opened the world's first porridge bar. This gr√∏d was the perfect fuel to warm me up on this brisk morning. (Ignore the iced coffee...I'm obviously a foreigner üòÑ)
