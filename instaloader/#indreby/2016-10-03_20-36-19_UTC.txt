We have a very serious case of sushi-related food coma here. ğŸš¨ Oh my, currently even breathing is a challenge. Need... to ... lie ... down! 
Why do I never know when I have had enough?! ğŸ˜£ 
Anyways, I had a fun evening with my colleagues. We first went to the @mysterymakers escape room challenge (we made it out of the lab with only 2 min left on the clock ğŸ™ˆ) and then had dinner at Sticks'n'Sushi. This is how Mondays should be like. ğŸ˜Š
