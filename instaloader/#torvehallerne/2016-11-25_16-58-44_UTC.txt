Sunset over Torvehallerne 😍 On my way home, this caught my eye, and I took a few minutes to apreciate the fleeting beauty. It put a smile on my face and took that days stress away ❤Have any of you taken 5 minutes today, simply to be?..😊 ----------------------------------
By the way; my favorite time of day is twillight. Especially on the days when you can scent the season in the air
