#Potters : Do you also make rainbows with your clay after an unsuccessful #throwing session? I’m actually not sure why I do that.

This was supposed to be a ramen #bowl, but it ended up being a regular bowl 🤣 I'm satisfied with the way it turned out. I used a different #clay and I like it much more than the smooth white clay. It was way easier to throw with despite my failed attempt the first time. For me, it is important to use clay you are comfortable with when you first start throwing. Even the smallest #achievement can boost your self-confidence!
