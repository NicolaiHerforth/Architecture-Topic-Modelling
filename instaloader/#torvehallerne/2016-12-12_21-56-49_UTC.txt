I got to use my tea knowledge tonight, as I taught the sweet employees at Tante T in Torvehallerne some tea geek info! Kind of fun doing it again after having done something completely different in almost 3 years, but I actually remembered it all, only thing not so good is that they have moved the tea tins around ðŸ˜‚#teawithmettemarie #backatTanteTashortbit #tealady #teasomelier #tantet #torvehallerne
