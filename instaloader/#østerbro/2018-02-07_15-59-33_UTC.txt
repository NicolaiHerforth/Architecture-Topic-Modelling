Well, ladida! Someone have spent quite the right amount of money on charity the old hospital.

The text says, in older Danish: 
Private investor Simon Aron Eibeschütz and wife Rose born Wallick have by gift certificate of August the 16th 1852 donated 10000 Rigsdaler* for beds to the hospital, both for males and females. *Old currency in Denmark at that time.

Seen in the valuts at the old municipal hospital of Copenhagen, now closed and a part of Copenhagen University.
