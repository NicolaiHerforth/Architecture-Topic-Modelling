Brunch at @madogkaffe is always a good idea, specially when you share it with other foodies that you meet through this amazing community called @instagram 💙
.
Leah @questionably_adulting, her friend and myself shared 3 magnificent brunch plates at one of Copenhagen’s faves.
You have quite a selection of options to choose from. 3 for 89DKK, 5 for 129DKK and 7 for 154DKK
.
Take for example what you see on the photo: fried eggs, organic bread with butter, avocado with toasted almonds, blueberry yoghurt topped off with granola, homemade chicken nugget with sweet n’ sour sauce, Danish cheese with marmalade, salmon, pastries and a long list of mouth-watering etceteras 😋🥐🍳☕️🧀🥖🥗
.
Be prepared to wait in line and to be stared at when taking lots of photos though 🙋🏽‍♂️😌📸
.
Tak for mad my friends, it’s always a pleasure to eat your food ❤️
