The breakfast was so filling and we did not get hungry. So on the way to back home we got these gorgeous Danish open sandwiches, smørrebrød at food market for early dinner. They are sooooo gooood 👍 #torvehallerne #smørrebrød #copenhagen #inspirationtrip #healthylifestyle #nordicinspiration #lovesmallthingsinlife
