In Scandinavia oriental brassica is normally grown in the spring and fall, because they bolt in the summer heat. We only had one summer day in July. Temperature around 18-20°C — so why not try to grow a favourite out of season ? They still bolt, so there's no cut & regrow, only one happy harvest. Backup plants is ready, oriental greens is still a great crop, because they can be seeded until September and make powerful salads into October and November.
