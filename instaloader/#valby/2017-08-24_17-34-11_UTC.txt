Dinner on pointðŸŒ¸ and perfect to fuel a hard working machine ðŸ˜…
.
Today it's time for sushi (again) and I love it! .
Those ricepaper rolls are my favorites - they're filled with salmon, snow crab, avocado, salad & cucumber ðŸ’•
.
Heaps of protein, healthy fats and greensðŸŒ±what's not to like..
