When you’re at Torvehallerne, the biggest food market in Copenhagen, and you’d like to have something Danish, something delicious, and something good to remember Copenhagen by, then this is for you.

Smørrebrød got all of that in the fresh, flavourful, scrumptious and artfully stacked little package. Hallernes Smørrebrød at Torvehallerne makes these traditional Danish open-faced, brown bread sandwiches from a selection of local ingredients that changes daily.
