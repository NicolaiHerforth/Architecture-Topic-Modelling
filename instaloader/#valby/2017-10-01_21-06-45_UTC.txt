Now that phase 1 of our remodel is coming to a close, we have the pleasure of putting up art pieces and making this house more of a home. A precious heirloom from my Grandma Weesie now hangs in the entryway- each woman represents the clothing worn from different Danish islands and regions. Reading about each area and the people that come from there fills my heart with an indescribable feeling of love, respect, and honor to be another link in the chain of that rich Danish blood. I am so grateful for my ancestors and the beautiful, artistic, humble example of one of the most influential people in my life, my "maga". ❤️#denmark #danish #jensen #danishart #jensenfamily #ancestors #familytree #ringkøbing #skovshoved #amager #valby #ærø #fano
