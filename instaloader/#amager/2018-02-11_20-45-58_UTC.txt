SUNDAY OCR ELITE TRAINING✌🏼
.
So this video was captured today after an absolutely awesome training with a bunch of Danish ocr elite athletes.
.
It was snowing big time when we started the session outside and it pretty much continued the whole training.
.
The session was kind of a ocr race with about 350 m of running in between heaps of obstacles. We ended up with 8 km and a hole lot of obstacles😃
.
 I was literally soaked afterwords and I looked like a panda as I started with mascara on 🐼 but damn this training was a blast!
.
After a shower we played around with some 10kg weighted chinups and pullups☝🏼 .
