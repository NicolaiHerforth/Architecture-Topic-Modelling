Hotel & Restaurant Fy & Bi, Valby. Halloween is an ancient celtic tradition (Samhain) to celebrate witches, ghosts and the dark powers. Christianity (catholicism) tried to it take over, and called it Allehelgensaften, All Saints Evening. Protestants disliked catholic traditions, so in 1770, it was abolished. But since 2000 the celtic tradition has been transformed and returned from the USA, and orange pumpkins with lights inside can be seen everywhere.
