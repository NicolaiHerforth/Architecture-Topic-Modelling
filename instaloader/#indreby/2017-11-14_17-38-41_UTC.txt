I would very much have liked to see how the surroundings looked like back in King Christian IV 'th days. Back then, in the Renaissance, this was his "cottage" and the quite large Kitchengarden which where placed in the park supplied vegetables for the Royal Court. 
If you haven't seen the Castle from inside, you should. Theres so many beautiful items and several fun gadgets. I guess the King was a bit weird.
