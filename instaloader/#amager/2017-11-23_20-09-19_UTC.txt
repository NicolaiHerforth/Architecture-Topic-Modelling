FÃ¦llessang pÃ¥ #Amager ðŸŽ¤ðŸŽ¼ðŸŽ¶ I've taken my bows
And my curtain calls.
You brought me fame and fortune, and everything that goes with it.
I thank you all.

But it's been no bed of roses,
No pleasure cruise.
I consider it a challenge before the whole human race,
And I ain't gonna lose.

We are the #champions, my friends,
And we'll keep on fighting 'til the end.
We are the champions, we are the champions ðŸŽ¹
