Nanok Bar, Aksel Sandemoses Plads/Valby Langgade 126 (building from 1902). Local classical bar since … when do I know? Despite the Greenlandish name, the only thing referring to that place is the polar bears. In the 1970s it was a workers’ bar, and the atmosphere inside still smells of those times. Mommy seems to distract the kids’ attention from the bar, and the wall painting “Karriere” (“Carreer”) - "Don't go that way"? #valby #værtshus #localbar #total_denmark  #københavn #copenhagen #danskerneshistorie #københavn #copenhagen #aokdk #visitcopenhagen #igerscopenhagen #cphpicks #mitkbh  #nofilter #udenfilter #loves_united_copenhagen #tipkbh #facadefortællinger
