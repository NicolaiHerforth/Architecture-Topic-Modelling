The quintessential coffee stop - important component of training all year round. New stop today at @enghavesmorrebrod who treated us with big smiles and warm no-nonsense coffee ☕️👌🏻. I couldn’t resist the temptation to test their ‘øllebrød’ - a beer/bread-based porridge with whipped vanilla cream. It was freakin’ awesome. We recommend visiting this fine spot🙏🏼
