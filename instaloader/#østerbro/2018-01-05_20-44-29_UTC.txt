Lille Amalienborg is the unofficial name of a mansion that the contractor/entrepreneur Harald Simonsen (1873-1949), the father of Erna Hamilton, built in 1917 as a private residence at the then Østerbrogade, now Dag Hammarskjöld Allé 28, on Østerbro, Copenhagen. The building was designed by architect Carl Brummer, who specialized in the construction of villas and mansions for the higher citizenship and nobility.
During the german occupation, General Hermann von Hanneken received a message from Berlin that he should find a suitable headquarters, instead of the Hotel D'Angleterre. The Danish state was ordered to purchase Harald Simonsen's big villa called "Lille Amalienborg".
For a number of years, the house was later used by the Danish Red Cross as its headquarters, but in 2007 it was bought by the rich Fritz Schur for 67 million dkr. It was the most expensive house deal in Denmark that year. Now it has been sold again after it has been bad neglected, and is going to host the Turkish Embassy i Copenhagen. 
Harald Simonsen's daughter Erna Hamilton (known from the TV documentary Countess on the third floor) grew up in the house in the early 1900s. 
The property's land area is 1,596 m² and the living area 1,839 m². The property consists of a four storey large house with two separate garages and there is also a shelter under the basement. #ernahamilton #grevindenpåtredje #lille #amalienborg #lilleamalienborg #grevinde #grevinden #countess #turkishembassy #østerbro #daghammarskjold #architecture #housegoals #redcross #rødekors #ww2 #occupation #palæ #mansion
