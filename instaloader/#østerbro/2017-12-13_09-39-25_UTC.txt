SALIG JUL OG KALENDERGAVER #13

Yoga teacher Ieva Aleknaite explains: To fall in love with yourself and to care deeply for your body, mind and soul is the greatest gift you can give yourself. Perhaps it might sound selfish, doing something good or treating yourself nicely, but instead see it as little improvements; to be happier and healthier, a better version of you. The version that everyone around you will enjoy. The version that can be an example and an inspiration for others.

Self love is also about taking care of your environment, the well being of people, animals and nature around you. So go ahead and take time to relax in the sauna, do yoga, take a long walk, eat a plant based diet and start listening to the voice within that knows what is best! To fall in love with yourself and to care deeply for your body, mind and soul is the greatest gift you can give to yourself and the world.
