One of my favorite places in Copenhagen is Amager Fælled. The “park” even contains a piece of original nature that has been untouched since before Copenhagen was established, and means a great deal to the biodiversity of the area. It’s important to guard such areas from steel and concrete, I believe they’re important to man’s mental health.
