🥢🍺 RAMMEN // This is where I go whenever I am craving a delicious vegan ramen. Actually @ramentobiiruvbro bro has 3 different vegan options to choose from and they are both delicious. And of course some great beers from @mikkellerbeer to go down with it.

This is the No Meet Ramen and it has a lovely broth of Kombu (Japanese seaweed), with Shoyu-taré (the flavor base for the ramen, soy-sauce), sesame oil and homemade garlic/ginger oil. Topped with mushrooms, wakame seawees and spring onions. 😋Yummy. 💛 
Have you tried it yet?
