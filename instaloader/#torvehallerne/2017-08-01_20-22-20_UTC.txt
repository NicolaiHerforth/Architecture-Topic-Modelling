One of the best parts of traveling is most definitely the food! I always make this a key part of my day whether it's checking out restaurants, coffee shops, street food or the open air markets. This yummy rosemary bread was found in the wild at Torvehallerne in Copenhagen. If you didn't know Copenhagen is actually a total foodie heaven, now you do. Some of the World's Best List hails from this fantastic city. If you find yourself in Copenhagen, check out the Torvehallerne market. It has tons of vendors and some great outdoor seating to grab some tasty treats and a beer to enjoy the day! üçª
