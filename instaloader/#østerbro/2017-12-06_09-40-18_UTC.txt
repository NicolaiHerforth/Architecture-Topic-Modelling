There’s a craze for new balconies in elder town houses in Copenhagen. However, several of these balcony projects end up destroying the aesthetic balance of the houses. This functionalistic apartment house by a no-name functionalistic architect, probably from the thirties, shows how delicately and elegant a balcony can be utilized, when it’s part of the original concept. The modern refurbishments are normally anonymous assembly line work with a quest of being discreet, which, however, often ends up making the houses strangely schizoid in their appearance. #søerne #thelakes #functionalism #funktionalisme #midcenturymodern #architecture #arkitektur #archilover #architecturephotography #architecturalphotography #architizer #architecturestudents #architecturestudent #architectureporn #architettura #architecturelovers #architecturedesign #balcony #balconies #bauhaus #delditkbh #wonderlustcopenhagen #copenhagen #østerbro #architecture_hunter #danskarkitektur #altan #altaner #architecturewatch
