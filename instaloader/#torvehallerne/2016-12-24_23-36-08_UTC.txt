Coffee Collective (@coffeecollectif) 
Our first coffee in #denmark. Straight out of the train from the airport. Hands still freezing from the flight over. Before the #Noma -graduate #tacos at @hijadesanchez. This place is on point. Appoint them the #Danish ambassadors to #hipster coffee already. @torvehallerne isn't the most fun place to eat in #copenhagen -- that would be @copenhagenstreetfood -- but it's worth showing up here for the #coffee. #cphstreetfood #papirÃ¸en #cappuccino #denmarkðŸ‡©ðŸ‡° #torvehallerne #nordic #scandi #coffeeshots #kafedakicoffeestories
