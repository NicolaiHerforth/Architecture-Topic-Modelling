So we ran out of organic reusable bamboo cups ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜€ It's fantastic news, because it means we are leading the way to a more sustainable future together. #Copenhagen, you are absolute heroes. We have ordered more bamboo cups, and we should be receiving them any day now. In the meantime, you can enjoy your coffee from our compostable single use paper cups if you are on the go (ðŸ“· by @tipspills) #torvehallerne #kaffe
