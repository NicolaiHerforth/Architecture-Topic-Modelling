Josh had a porter and I had a danskvand (seltzer) at this pub, #jernbanecafeen across from the main railway station in #copenhagen. Apparently, it’s the 3rd best pub in the city, but I have decided it’s number one, due to its very unique character. It captures the soul of #Vesterbro, while also being international (travelers, right off the train naturally venture in here all the time). Previous owner (second generation out of three), Lars P. Plays every Sunday and Wednesday night. He is on the left in my sketch, playing the keyboard. The singer (not sure who that was), sang loud and slightly out of tune, which was great. #københavn #nightlife #copenhagenbynight #jernbanecaféen #pub #værtshus #sketch #sketchbook #sketchbookpage #blackandwhitedrawing #drawing #tegning #natteliv #nightlife
