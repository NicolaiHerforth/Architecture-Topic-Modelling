Thursday night I had dinner with sweet @tuni.metropolife at the little hidden gem, @restaurant_zeleste, downtown Copenhagen. We had such a cozy time with good food and wine in their charming courtyard 🌿 I've written about how a casual burger date turned into a three course meal and it's on the blog now 🍾🍴🌿 Dinner was #sponsored by the lovely @restaurant_zeleste ✨
