2 days and counting! This cast can be both serious and silly and they’re ready to act, sing and dance their hearts out on stage for you. For you dedicated CTC patrons, please note that Sleeping Beauty takes place on a new stage for us - Zangenbergs Teater. This charming theatre in Indre By is only a five minute walk from Nørreport St. Hope to see you there soon! 🎭🎉🙌 #ctcsleeping
