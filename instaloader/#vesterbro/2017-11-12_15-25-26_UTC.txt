Based in London, the Live Art Development Agency (LADA) is a Centre for Live Art - a knowledge and research centre, a production centre for programmes and publication, and an online centre for representation and dissemination. LADA works to create the conditions in which diversity, innovation and risk in contemporary culture can thrive, develop new artistic frameworks, legitimise unclassifiable artforms, and give agency to underrepresented artists, practices and histories.
