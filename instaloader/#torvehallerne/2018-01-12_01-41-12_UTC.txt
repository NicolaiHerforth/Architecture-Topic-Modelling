Margaherita - Gorm's Torvehallerne - Since it's start in 2007 Gorms pizza has become known as some of the best pizza in Copenhagen. A thin base in the roman tradition with a rich sauce and delicate cheese. Garnished with basil and a little salt and pepper this really popped, it's a must try. #torvehallerne #copenhagen #denmark #pizza #italian #tomato #mozzarella #basil #foodstyling #foodphoto #food #foodporn #hygge #comfortfood #italianfood #musteat #baconrollsetcdk #baconrollsetc
