Back in beautiful Copenhagen 🇩🇰
I spent a long and relaxing weekend at home with my family. Besides all the good food, walking the dogs and sleeping in, I had some great conversations with my Mum. Reflecting on how much I have changed and grown in just the past 2 years. 💫 It made me realize that most of what I never thought to be possible was actually happening. Being comfortable with who I am, trusting that my path, even if it might not be for everyone, is the right one for me and most importantly I could distance myself from constantly comparing myself to others 💕 
Saying that out loud (or putting it into words) is scary but the fact that there is people out there who are fighting the exact same battles and appreciate it. And for me, it is also just such a great way to reflect and remind myself that I have come a long way already! 🙌🏼💪🏼💕
