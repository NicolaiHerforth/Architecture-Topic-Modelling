There were a lot of amazing fireworks on display tonight, but I also quite liked this quiet little fire burning brightly in the middle of the street. ...
I was going to write a long and/or inspirational post about 2017, the new year etc, but the truth is I'm really not the type. I will say this: 2017 was interesting and I am truly excited to welcome a new year with new adventures. Let's all try to be a bit more like the little fire: wherever we are, whatever we've got, we're gonna burn brightly ğŸ”¥
Happy New Year! âœ¨
