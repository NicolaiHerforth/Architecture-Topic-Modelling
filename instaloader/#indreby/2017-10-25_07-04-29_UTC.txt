Once again an example of how you can pass by the same place a hundred times and not see what's right in front of you until one day you all of the sudden realize the beauty of something. In this case the former bank near Nørreport station, on the corner of Købmagergade and Nørre Voldgade. "Den Danske Landmandsbank" means "The Danish Farmer Bank". It was established in 1871 and was quickly grew to be the biggest bank in the North. Today the bank is called Danish Bank and is still the biggest in the country. But the building now houses outlet sales. #nørreport #nørreportstation #dendanskelandmandsbank #danskebank #landmandsbanken #nørrevoldgade #købmagergade #indreby #delditkbh #kigopkbh #mursten #ihavethisthingwithbricks
