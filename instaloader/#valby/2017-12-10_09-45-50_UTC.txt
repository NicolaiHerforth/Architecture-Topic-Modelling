Christmas Basket â€“ Ceramic Cups
---------------------------------
Ceramic cups made by a local ceramic artist Gitte Luna Bramm can be a perfect fit for your coffee or tea, as ceramic retains heat better and does not affect the flavor of your beverage. 
The cups come in two sizes and two different shapes. They all are unique and there is no cup alike.

The cups are part of our Christmas Basket, but they can also be purchased separately at our roastery and coffee shop at Langgade st.
