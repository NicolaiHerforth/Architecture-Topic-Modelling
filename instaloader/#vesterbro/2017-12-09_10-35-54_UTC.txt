Two years ago in early December I wrote a song called "Christmas in Vesterbro". It remains one of my most enduring and meaningful songs. This photo was taken on the night we recorded it with Christian and Julien. The recording didn't come out great because my voice was shot after a December of #havingtoomuchfun ; still, I sing this song regularly even though its journey started a world away. #merrychristmas #glædeligjul #copenhagen #vesterbro #denmark #københavn #vesterbronx #juletid #juleøl #songwriter #music #friends
