Mommy took me to her gallery today, she was so busy the whole week, because of a new exhibition. I really like this one, by a young Danish artist Jonas Brocklehurst, he’s pretty good with a pencil. This dog doesn’t seem like having any ear problems after swimming like I do. I wish my ears could be more like that...... have to wait another month before beach...... and one more time at the vet...... then hopefully she gives me green light for swimming 🏊🐾💚 @opengallery.dk #f1labrador #f1 #labrador #labradog #blacklabrador #black #drawing #bulldog #bigears #dog #pet #art #tegning #kunst #artwork #gallery #gallerydog #contemporaryart #artforsale #instaart #artofheday #dogoftheday #copenhagen #denmark #amager #amagerbro #abstractart #abstract #smile
