Hi, I’m Alan. A few weeks ago I went to a @tullamoredew event, where they took a DNA sample in collaboration with @myheritage_official . So they could create a personal kit of my heritage. Thanks for that BTW 🙏
.
I was born and raised in Denmark. My parents were Danish, my grandparents were Danish as well. But it turns out that only approx. 47-48 percent of my genetic heritage ( for the last 8-10 generations) is related to Scandinavia. Therefore #iamblend and most of us are. Only 0,3 percent of people have genetic heritage from only one area( source: myheritage global database ). In days such as these, maybe that is something to reflect on.🤔
.
#Iamblend and we are blended.  So let’s sing, dance & celebrate together. Be kind, take care & let’s focus on the good things.
.
Best wishes & cheers 🎉✌️😄
