After 3 months of delay due to a fire, a lot of work and help from friends and family, we are FINALLY opening our new location on Vesterbrogade 58 for lunch and dinner on Tuesday 16/01! Bring a friend, grab a bowl and support MÃ¦ndenes Hjem (50% of all our sales on Tuesday will go to that beautiful local non profit supporting the homeless in the city) ðŸ’›
