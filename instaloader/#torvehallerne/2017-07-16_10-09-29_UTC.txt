If you are in Copenhagen and if you are into coffee, you kinda have to go check out @coffeecollectif. You can visit their #Nørrebro location at Israels Plads and actually stay there for hours chilling and eating all that #Torvehallerne have to offer (which is a massive choice and brighter and cleaner than Papierøyen). Then you can head towards the city center and continue sightseeing. It's a nice plan for the day, but I actually have something else in mind, from the same starting point. Give me a little bit of walking time and I'll show you!
