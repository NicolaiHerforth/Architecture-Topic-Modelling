First there was Raid, our hoppy lager. Then there was 3X Raid, a tripple hopped explosive update on the original. Now we‚Äôre introducing 5X Raid - a quintuple hopped India Pale style Lager. More full-bodied than its predecessors, hoppy, floral, bitter and well-balanced with a full mouthfeel, leading to a light but lingering bitter finish. Now available on @toolbeerwebshop üçª
