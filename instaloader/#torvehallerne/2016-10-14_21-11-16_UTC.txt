#Tapas like #market at #Torvehallerne #foodmarket today was so #amazing for a #foodie like myself! Bottom left: #tartlet with free range chicken and  #organic #vegetables. Bottom right: Brittany #oysters with a glasset of #cava. Top left: #salmon #cod #ceviche with #passion fruit, daikon, chives, spring online, chili, lime, coriander and vanila. Top right: butter toasted #toast with thick skirt, onion and #cheddarcheese and a #beer from Svaneke brewery. Last I had a tiramisu from Gorm's Pizza.
Enjoyed together with @julienord89 and @helleriber
