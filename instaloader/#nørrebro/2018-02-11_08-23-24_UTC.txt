CPH: Asian fusion from @kungfuizakayabar serving up laid back pop-into-an-izakayabar-on-your-way-home-from-work realness. Awesome music plays from the the stereo and people dine and drink in this chilled restaurant. We ordered a jug of Tiger beer for the table and sampled their Mixed Menu. We start with a classic salad of onglet beef and cauliflower tossed in sesame and ponzu dressing - we drank up the dressing it was so good. Their spicy tuna maki packed a punched and their salmon, crab and avocado rolls with unagi sauce was so fine 👌🏼 We finished the meal with a beef spring roll, crispy chicken in buttermilk with cheese and chilli mayo and a box of steaming dim sum! Next time, we trying their ramen which looked packed with flavour!
