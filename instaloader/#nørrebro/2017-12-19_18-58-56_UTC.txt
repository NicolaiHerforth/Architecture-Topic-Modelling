Patella luxation - 13 years. Just because I do not look differently abled, it does not mean that I am not. I can not run, jump, or do most sport. I can not travel most places, and I am very bound to go with friends many places. Even a walk on the beach can be difficult, and I need someone to hold on to. This means that being alone in life for me, is even more a source for anxiety and isolation. So it organizes my social self on a subtile level, to be more pleasing and appealing. I can not just go to a festival and meet new people. If someone attacks me, I can not run away, and only defend myself with my upper body. I have to prepare, always, have tactics and even have many money for a taxi. It makes me socially insecure. When is it ok to ask for help? What if the elevator is out of service at the train station? If my friends are too drunk, can I take care of myself at a party? It affects many levels of life. I want to be free and Independent - but I am dependent. Not easy for my mindset and ego. The worst part is, that sometimes in my head it plays into my gender identity, and I feel more stereotypically feminine and helpless, than I want to. It is not easy. But today I have contacted a doctor, to see if modern science is up for my case - 13 years, please have something hitech in store 4 me... ðŸ‘½
