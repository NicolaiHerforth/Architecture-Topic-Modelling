Last year for their 10th Anniversary, @amagerbryghus decided to re-relase one of their really popular small batch beers from back in the day! This is MurpHill, a 10.5% Imperial Rye Porter that has been aged in Kentuckey Bourbon Barrels. This beer was originally brewed as a tribute to the two iconic American brewers Mike Murphy & Shaun Hill, who spent a good deal of time brewing beer here in Denmark. This beer is actually an amped up version, of Amagers Rug Porter, which both Mike and Shaun collaborated on. Thanks a ton to the Amager boys for re-releasing this awesome brew!!🔥🍺🍻🥃 Review live at:
