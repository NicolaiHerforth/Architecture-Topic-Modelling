Torvehallerne market in København is the place there we lost part of ourselves in pleasure: two very large halls are not far away from city centre afforded us the great satisfaction of delicious meals. Lots of little stalls selling fish, fruits & vegetables, beer, juice and "smørrebrød" 🐟🍸#denmark #torvehallerne #copenhagen #københavn #tasty #delicious #smorrebrod #spring #march #travel #traveling #aroundtheworld  #awesome #inlove #market
