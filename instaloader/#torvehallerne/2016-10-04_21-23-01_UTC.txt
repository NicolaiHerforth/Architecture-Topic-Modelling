Had such a great day with @ahumbleblazer 💕💫 We mingled with the tourists and went to Kastellet, Amalienborg, Marmorkirken, Rundetårn and more 👻 We finished our "trip" with some great, vegan food at #torvehallerne and I got to keep my clay cup 🌸🌸🌸 We also went to the new all vegan shop: Den Veganske Butik on Rosenborggade 🌱🌱🐷. It's so great to see all these new vegan places popping up all over the city 🙌😍😍
