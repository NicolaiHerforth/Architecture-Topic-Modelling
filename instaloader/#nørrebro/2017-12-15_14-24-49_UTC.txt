Resembles a postcard, from an enchanted dark palace, we getting closer to the darkest day of the year, so the astronomical cycle is almost at its end, and it’s the time when cycles spin faster, to slowly bring us to the point of regaining more light, the slow process of blending seasons, the slow process of aging might be faster than the slow process of waiting.
