Kongelunden part 1 - Much of Amager’s vast wilderness is unfamiliar to people from the island and Copenhagen, but the King’s Grove has been a popular spot for so long that it featured in an 1848 operetta.
The ambience among the many ageing trees is different to that on the open commons, where forests are only now beginning to gain a foothold. The King’s Grove is what many would call real forest. #amager  #govisitdenmark #visitamager #typicalscandinavia #thebestofscandinavia #iamnordic #igers_denmark #igers_copenhagen #loves_denmark #sharingcph #delditkbh #kigopkbh #voreskbh #trees #arkitektur #loves_united_copenhagen #loves_denmark #grove #solnedgang #trees #forrest #nature #natur #efterår #autumn #sti #path #tv2vejret #kongelunden #kingsgrove #visitcopenhagen
