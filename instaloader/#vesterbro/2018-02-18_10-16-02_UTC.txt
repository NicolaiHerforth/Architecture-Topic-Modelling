I went on a beer & vice tour yesterday in Copenhagen’s Vesterbro area, west of Copenhagen K. The best way I would describe it is as, hipster safari.  My guide, who’s blurred profile you see in the first image (Sorry Jam :D) highlighted the sketchy history of the area, before its gentrification and its presence today.  We visited three bars in the area, one a microbrewery going “global” to a smaller bar of particular notoriety. Between these bars, we saw the local sights and arts (Like the anti war piece of barbed wire and toy soldiers) It was a nice difference from the formal pieces of the Glyptoteket. Having a few drinks along the way was great too!  It was great, thanks @urbanadventures
