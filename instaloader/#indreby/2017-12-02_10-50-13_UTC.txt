Its not only interesting at the sunny side in Nyhavn, take the Courtyard here e.g with not only a first Backyard, but also a second as it where many places in Copenhagen earlier. This way more people could be housed. Back then I imagine rats and dirt was to be found here, but now a days its all been restored and looks amazing in here.
So if you are ever in Nyhavn, you should go see for yourself.
