This open sandwhich was one of my favourite foods whilst visiting Copenhagen. I couldn't tell you what all the ingredients were but it was delicious! If visiting Copenhagen I'd recommend paying a visit to the market Torvehallerne - lots of lovely food stalls and there's plently of places to pick up a snack while you're there too.
