I’m working on a 5 colors reduction cut of a sign (and the sky!) from ‘The Red Square’ in Copenhagen. The sign says ‘Moscow’ in Russian. 3 colors are done and I’m making a red and a blue variation. The last 2 colors will be Payne’s gray and black. #linocut #linogravure #linolschnitt #lino #reduction #reductionprint #copenhagen #nørrebro #denrødeplads
