Went through good times and shit times in this city, but met some amazing people and learned crazy much. I remember when I moved, before the first dishwasher paycheck, I use to collect cans and bottles on Fridays, on my way home bicycling, just to buy some extra beers with my roommate ðŸ˜„Now I am chilling in my 8th room(8th place since I got here,true storyðŸ˜Œ),planning and creating video content that can help others and release my constant need to express what is in. I also dont like beer anymore and now working on a small video project. 3 WEEKS OUT.
