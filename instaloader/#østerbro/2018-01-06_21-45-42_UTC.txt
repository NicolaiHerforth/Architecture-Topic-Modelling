The Plessen Mansion is the last nobility palace that was built in Copenhagen, and with 97 rooms one of the largest. The three-legged U-shaped floor plan was built 1901-06 in New Baroque style on the outside by Gotfred Tvede for the retired diplomat, Baron Joseph von Plessen (1860-1912). The main entrance is in a cour d'honneur towards Kristianiagade, but the palace also faces the Trondhjems Square. The palace is on three floors, of which a mezzanine is crowned by a mansard roof with black glazed tiles. 
The famous baroness and photographer Varvara Hasselbalch grew up in this palace.
The large hall, in which you arrive via the palace's original main entrance towards Kristianiagade, is covered with a magnificient chesd marble floor. From here, the grand staircase is also made of marble with a carefully designed wrought iron grille/fence and bronze lanterns. The staircase leads to the repos on the 1st floor. The staircase's underside and wall sections are still lined with the original lamps and the original piece of decoration in the New rococo style from the palace's construction on the inside.
From the landing large wing doors lead to the other salons and the library. The repos and the rotund are still with a few exceptions clad with the original stucco on the walls and ceilings. Even today there are several furniture from the house original interior in the rooms. #plessenskepalæ #domusmedica #varvara #varvarahasselbalch #mansion #copenhagen #storiesfromacity #rococo #baroque #interior #exterior #sharethecity #discovercopenhagen #østerbro #manorhouse
