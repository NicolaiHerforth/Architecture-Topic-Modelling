The Irish national dish, Irish Stew - not exactly insta-friendly, but a hearty hit every time. Traditionally the poor man's food with slowcooked potatoes, onions and lamb in layers added thyme, salt, pepper and water. I think best all combined with white cabbage and some carrots. Eat with ryebread and strong mustard 🇮🇪👌🏼#Irish #irishstew #stew #ireland #winter #food #foodie #vinter #winterfood #tradition #classic #lamb #gryderet #potatoes #foodsharing #hearty #heartyfood #tasty #longlasting #lecreuset #pot #cooking #diy #amager #copenhagen #københavm #denmark #danmark #february
