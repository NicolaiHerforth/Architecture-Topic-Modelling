I was moved by this program today. As a future white mom to a future biracial kid, in a pretty racist country, i have a lot of hope. That they would be included in everyday society in any way ğŸ’š I am 26 years old and i have never seen danish television like this. A white mom washing her sons dreadslocks ğŸ’š  #swirllife #interracialcouple #interracialfamilies #love #family #future #peacefully #dreadlocks #biraciallove #sprintergalore #ramasjang #copenhagen #nÃ¸rrebro #mom #son
