For some years ago while barbequeing in our little green spot I put on this little red lantern between two branches on our cherrytree and forgot to remove it after a long and hot summer. Now it is almost squeezed between those branches and in wintertime used as a bird feeder. #strongpowerofthenature #indreby #copenhagen
