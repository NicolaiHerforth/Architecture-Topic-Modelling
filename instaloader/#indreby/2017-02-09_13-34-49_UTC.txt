Classic Cheese Burger🐮🍔 (119DKK) and 🐔Club Sandwich (99DKK)
Located in Indre By (Copenhagen centre), this warm and cozy cafe sells burgers, sandwiches, salads and coffee. The medium beef burger was thick, juicy and flavourful. I really liked the toasted homemade brown bun which was tender and saturated with the juices of the burger. And the fries were one of the best I’ve had! 🍟
