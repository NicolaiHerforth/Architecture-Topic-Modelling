Some of our guests ask whether or not we serve food. Even though our house made snacks from @warpigs_brewpub_cph are pretty awesome, they might not fill you up. But we're lucky enough to be surrounded by two of the best restaurants in town on Viktoriagade: Start your day out at @restaurant_hyggestund (no. 6) (open 9:30AM- 3PM on weekends) with a delicious egg and bacon sandwich 🥓🍳 alongside a beer geek breakfast ☕ and then have some world class "smørrebrød" for lunch (noon to 4PM)/full menu for dinner (6PM-9:30PM) at @ol_brod (no. 6 as well) with stellar beer/aquavit pairings. And if you grab a beer at the bar afterwards... we won't hold it against you 🍻 CHEERS 🙏 #københavn #copenhagen #vesterbro #craftbeer
