"There's a first time for everything..."
.
Today the full portfolio of Thymiopoulos' Xinomavro-driven bottles had premiere on these solid Le Pinard shelves; first time on display together in Denmark... A big welcome to the newest addition, Naoussa 2014, now, all-in-all counting 5 (if we may say) top bottles, and, great material for a Naoussa Xinomavro masterclass, talking around what terroir and different ways of making wine can result in very different wines, even at the same winery...
