The main act: Caramelised roasted golden beet, goose from Gothenborg with fermented plum purÃ©e & confit goose leg gyoza made from leftover sourdough bread - the golden beet was unanimously considered the best dish weâ€™ve had on the trip, the slightly salty crust was caramelised to an almost candy-like chewy texture. Tasted beautifully on its own or with the pink, juicy and fatty perfectly cooked goose breast. We  loved how the dish also incorporated leftovers or scraps from the ingredients used in the restaurant. A true foodgasm experience! Could not get enough of this dish ðŸ˜­ #bestdishever #goldenbeets #goose  #wildgame #localproduce #organic #tastingmenu #dinner #foodgasm #michelin #restaurant #worlds50best #newnordic #nordiccuisine #instafood #bucketlist #foodie #travel #adventure #explore #nÃ¸rrebro #kÃ¸benhavn #denmark
