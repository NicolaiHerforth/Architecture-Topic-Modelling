At the doctor’s office today. 
In our grey and cold winter days without sunshine or snow a little extra candles and left over Christmas lighting makes everything better. 
In Copenhagen City many of the medical clinics are quite small and situated in old buildings just as the private apartments. I loved this place because it was quiet and didn’t feel like a medical clinic at all.
The view through this window was to the private backyard - these backyards are often hidden treasures in the city.
