I wonder what was going through their minds..... it was their free period to play outside at school.  But across the street from the girls, there were adults drinking coffee at #torvehallerne , and the girls were watching.  It's funny how as children we might have believed that adults got to have all the fun.  And yet as adults we often long for the days of less responsibility and scheduled play times ðŸ˜‰. Either way, there are great things about each season of life.  But someone might need to go gently remind those girls of that.
