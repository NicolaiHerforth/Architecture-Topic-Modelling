On Copenhagen: A Danish sandwich

Smørrebrød from Hallernes. There was also a queue at this stall, for the artfully arranged bites of traditional Danish open-faced sandwiches. They do look like 3D sculptures of edible art and one made it to the table. It was horrendously expensive (DKK95!) however, and tastewise, overkill of the mayonnaise although it was somewhat redeemed by the presence of dill. The tiny prawns were sweet and had an interesting, slightly chewy texture. More form over substance for this stall....
