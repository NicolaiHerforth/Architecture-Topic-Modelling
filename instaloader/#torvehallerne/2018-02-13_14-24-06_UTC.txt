Copenhagen's covered market... the best place to get cinnamon buns, great coffee, delicious smorgasbord and pretty much any high-quality edible good. Thank you @rosiejoans for a weekend-changing recommendation! ☕️🍩🥙Its also centrally located, pretty as anything, appears to be the stomping ground of hot hipster dads and sells beautiful flowers 🌷
