Morning run, 20 km in pace 5.40 😅
One of my favorite “sightseeing runs” is the route to Dragør and back. It is a little town only 10 km from #Copenhagen but with an identity of its own 😊 I run there, look at the sea, the ships and the bridge to Sweden and run back 🏃🏼‍♀️ Today was very foggy and I could only see one boat out there, therefore the second picture is a throwback to a glorious sunrise a few weeks ago #run #running #runner #runnerslife #runninggirl #marathoner #løb #løberliv #træning #asicsfrontrunner #asicsfrontrunnerdenmark #dragør #Amager #womensrunningcommunity
