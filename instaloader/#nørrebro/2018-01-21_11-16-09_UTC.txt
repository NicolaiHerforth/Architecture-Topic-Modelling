Super Colours at Superkilen #🇩🇰 #Superkilen #park in #Copenhagen is 3 sections, The Red Square, The Black Market and The Green Park, each with a different purpose of use, but all celebrating the diversity of the neighbourhood of #Nørrebro. You will spot plants and items from all over the world, such as a fountain from Morocco or swings from Iraq.
