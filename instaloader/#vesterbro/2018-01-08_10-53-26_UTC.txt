#CARITAS

The source of inspiration was the set of inscriptions "AGIS" and "MARIA on the  ring no. 252 part of the medieval ring collection of National Museum of Denmark - 
Agis was mild, considerate and charitable. Maria was receptive and gentle.
Like Agis and Maria, this ring of charity gives out goods and gold.
