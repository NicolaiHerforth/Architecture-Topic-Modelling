Was glad today to find a completely new place (for me) with #vegan and #vegetarian food options. We had some delicious #pies, first filled with #broccoli and #edamame beans and then some #kidneybeans, #mushrooms and #veggies #curry. 😍 Also didn't know that this kind of #pie was a #NewZealander thing, but the place is all references to it 😬😉 Can't wait to go back and try the sweet stuff they also have 🤗 #copenhagen #yummy #yum #veganfood #sunday #lunch #valby #NewZealand 😜
