Two weeks inside and look!  Insolation = ✔️ building the level = ✔️ Find a harbour for the boat = ✔️ 🔜 plumbing and electrical!
I cannot explain how luck has striked us!!! We found the most peacefull, serene and beautiful harbour in Copenhagen with green areas and a beach 30 meters away ! #østerbro #wearecominghome #houseboat #dreams #2018 #gonnabecrazy #acrazylovestory #learningbydoing #proud #fiskerihavnen #buildingadream #ourjourney #livingatsea #husbåd #boatliving #copenhagen #copenhagenharbour
