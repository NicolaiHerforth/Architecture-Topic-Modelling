My #mother @faroe_kvivik_nature came to #Denmark last #sunday and went back to the #faroeislands #today 💕
While she was here I took her to @creativespacecph in #østerbro as a birthday present 🎁🎈
It's a wonderful studio where they provide everything you need to paint ceramics 😀
She chose a #teapot and I chose a liddet jar which I will post later 😊
The pot looks #pastel but when it's been glazed an bury it will be a perfect #chtismas red with #snowflakes 🎅❄🤶
