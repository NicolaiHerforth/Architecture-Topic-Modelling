This is Hans. He is 90. He is a very quiet man. So i asked him about his life. And he blew me away. He has been a pilot for 50 years. Lived in Australia, California, New Zealand, Cambodja, Thailand and Vesterbro. He flew missions for Edmund Hillary in his prime and had stories about what the world looked like many years ago. His guidance to the younger was "stay natural, stay young". Fucking bl√¶ret makks. #edmundhillary #kiwie #hans #glaedeligjul #vesterbro
