Today I’ve got amazed and surprised by the drivers in Copenhagen east! In a big crossroad with 16 lanes + bicycle lanes all of the traffic lights had shut down during rush hour traffic! As I drove closer to the crossroad, I was already afraid how it would turn out, since I’m shocked daily by how fast, irresponsible and carelessly people drive (cars and bicycles). But when I approached the crossroad I got stunned!! I’ve NEVER seen a more pleasant and smooth rush hour traffic scene; everyone was polite, patient, staying in their lane, respecting traffic laws (especially ‘priority to the right’) and looking after one another 😮😍 Amazing what a little mindfulness can do to people 😉🙏 #mindfulness #awareness #beaware #traffic #trafficjam #rushhour #rushhourtraffic #bepresent #monotasking #thenewblack #yogaoffthemat #yogateacher #yogateacherlife #reflection #københavn #myldretid #trafiklys #lyskryds #yogalærer #østerbro
