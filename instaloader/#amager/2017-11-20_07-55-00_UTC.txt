My wheels echo quietly and meet the almost indiscernable sound of a wave, then another. Like the strokes of my thighs are so slight and insignificant compared to the depth and history of every wave, so the power of my will and actions are almost nothing in the wideness and complexity of the world around, behind, and ahead. The more I listen to the waves, the better I become at becoming part of them, instead of seeking to master or harness their forces. Embracing gradually replaces struggling.
