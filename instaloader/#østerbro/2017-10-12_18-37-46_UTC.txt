I spend a shit load of time in other wise near empty stadiums waiting for my children to finish training. I used to spend that time working or reading but now I just stare and do nothing but that and breathe. Empty stadiums have something zen like going on, pigeons under the roof, a lonely runner, a boy kicking a ball, silence so present it's almost loud. As a kid I used to spend my free time running tracks like these over and over again. The smell is the same, the urge to run is still there, although if I did I would probably be hospitalized within 5 minutes #Ã¸sterbro #stadion #stadium #trackandfield #sprint #training #running
