A Royal Arena (part 2), the new multi arena In Copenhagen. Central to the design is a podium linking to the adjoining neighborhood. This feature is designed to effectively absorb the movement of spectators through a variety of small plazas, pockets and gathering areas that have been carved from the podium’s perimeter. It simultaneously encourages the community to embrace the variety of public spaces, staircase and adjacencies, which promote activity and liveliness when the building is not in use.

The wave-like semi-transparent facade that seemingly ‘dances’ above the surrounding podium allows people on the outside to enjoy glimpses of the activities within. The wavelike movements lift up slightly above the natural entry points of the Arena making way-finding easy and logical. The fins comprising the facade add warmth and texture to the building, giving the Arena a light and elegant expression. #3xn #architecture #a #arena #facade #royalarena #stadion #concerthall #multiarena #amager #ørestad #visitamager #cphpicks #copenhagen #københavn #sharingcph #delditkbh #voreskbh #igerscopenhagen #igersdenmark #loves_united_denmark #loves_united_copenhagen #loves_denmark #typicalscandinavia #iamnordic #copenhagenfacades
