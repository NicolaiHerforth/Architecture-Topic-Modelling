ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡°: Brunch in Copenhagen at the big food market, Torvehallerne. This stall had a great little brunch menu with danish cheeses and cured meats, along with a cheese and egg sandwich, chutneys and some local ciders. So good I really like Torvehallerne, they also have the place that does the famous porridge. Make sure you visit!
