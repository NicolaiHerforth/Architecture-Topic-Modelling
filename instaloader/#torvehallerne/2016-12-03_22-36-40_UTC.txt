Is Hygge just hype? Coziness, simple pleasures, a mood, an atmosphere - whatever. I'm not going to fight about translations, lets just call it CAKE. For Day 3 we're at Torvehallerne Market in Copenhagen, stuffing our faces with GIANT CINNAMON ROLLS warm from the oven, plastered with sweet, buttery icing. This is why Denmark is the 'World's happiest country' (There's probably more to it than cake, but who cares?).
