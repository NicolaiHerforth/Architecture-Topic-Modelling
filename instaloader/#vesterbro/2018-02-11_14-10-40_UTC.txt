Nordre Kapel (1892), Vestre Kirkegård (1870). The northern cemetery chapel on a freezing cold February morning. Designed by the architect Hans Jørgen Holm (1835-1916). On Denmark’s by far largest cemetery (500x1000 meters), this sort of building is bigger than most cathedrals or churches in any Danish city in the province. The first two decades, the cemetery was for poor people who couldn’t afford to pay for a tomb. They were buried from a small wooden shack with a wooden cross. Only when this chapel was built, more wealthy people found it acceptable to be buried here. Two more chapels (Southern and Eastern) were added 1906 and 1913. #hansjørgenholm #vestrekirkegård #Vesterbro #cemetery #friedhof #arkitektur #architecture #architecturelovers #bygningskultur #bygningshistorie #danskerneshistorie #total_denmark #københavn #copenhagen #visitcopenhagen #cphpicks #mitkbh #canonphotography #loves_united_copenhagen #copenhagen_insta #tipkbh #voreskbh #wonderlustcopenhagen #copenhagensworld #archi_focus_on #archi_unlimited #archi_ologie #houseportrait
