If you are in #copenhagen one of the first things you gotta try is #smorrebrod which is buttered rye bread with various toppings. This guy is making smoked salmon  smorrebrod at the @torvehallernekbh market. You get smorrebrod with an array of schnaps to choose from. I loved it.  Follow for more 👍👍
