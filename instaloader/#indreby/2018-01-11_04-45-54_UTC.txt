"You must be the laughing Lama" our wonderful guide told me as we walked down the mountain of Tiger's Nest in Bhutan 🇧🇹 back in June 2016.
"Yes, Kristine the Lama comes in many different characters", he continued as I tried to laugh his words of me. 🙏

This laugh is real, I know. Yet despite its sincere and a peace breaker it does affect some people in a less peaceful way. I keep reminding myself that I am me, my laughter is often loud and if it's an issue worth moaning about from other people its none of my business. ☯ +🕉️ =♥ #grounded
