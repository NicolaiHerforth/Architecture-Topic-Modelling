This rather long and yellow wall is an iconic pointer for locals and visitors alike in NÃ¸rrebro....especially when using the bus, you are likely to get instructions such as: youâ€™ll have to get off at the first stop after the yellow wall ðŸ˜Š Behind the wall youâ€™ll find Assistens Cemetery. The final resting place of great men like H.C.Andersen and SÃ¸ren Kirkegaard. However, for me, at this time of the year itâ€™s a welcomed splash of colour on a gray winterâ€™s day
