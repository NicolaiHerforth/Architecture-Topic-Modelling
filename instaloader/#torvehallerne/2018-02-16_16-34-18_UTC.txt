We could not help but to showcase these so gorgeous tropical veggs and fruits we found in Torvehallerne. We're so used to rough stalls when it comes to gnams, plantains and so on. Not only are they merchandised superbly but on top you can get a freshly squeezed juice out of them. And guess what is even avant-garde Danish style ( apart from the crazy pricing 😁) ? The possibility to drink fresh sugar cane juice - that is really something to me because I love it so much! Let's start the year amazingly 😉 . . . .
