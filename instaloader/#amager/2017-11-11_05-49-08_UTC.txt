Sigtebroad, India Pale Ale 6.8% Amager Bryghus Kastrup Denmark in collaboration with Trillium Brewing Company Boston MA USA.

And yes.. another ipa found it's way to my glass.
I guess Amager found in Trillium a collaboration partner many would dream of, after all Trillium is on top of the hypes when it comes to ipa's. I mean many trade like crazy at this moment to score Trillium cans from the US. And i must say thumbs up to Amager how they find one good collaboration partner after the other.
The idea for this Sigtebroad (or SigtebrÃ¸d) ipa came from Trillium main man Jean Claude "JC" Tetreault. The idea was to brew a ipa with basicly the same ingredients as the historical Danish SigtebrÃ¸d bread. The history of this bread goes back to the are of vikings and Amager tells us the story on the label about the bread beeing substitute for the viking longbow and bakery girls with long knifes.. well good cafÃ© stories while enjoying this ipa ðŸ˜‰
They gave the beer a US touch by using hops suchs as Columbus, Amarillo and Citra, also honey was used, which had giving the beer some sweet smoothness.
The result is a decent ipa but i also must say it dind't blew me away. With such a collaboration partner the expectations go naturaly to very high levels i guess.
The beer is juicy hazy, medium juicy nose and juicy of tropical fruit, citrus, mango and a sweet touch. The bitter in medium dry.
A easy drinker, nice beer but as said.. you always hope for more in case of such a collab.
Oh.. and i saw Trillium also released the beer as a can version for the US.
Enjoy your weekend.
Cheers!
