We are excited to introduce you to our latest project, the pastry and coffee roastery Andersen & Maillard. Beside enjoying freshly roasted coffee, you will be spoiled by Milton Addison Abel with his delicacies. He has honed his skills at the world famous NOMA, but was originally trained at the classically inclined gourmet restaurant French Laundry in California. Are you in for a treat? Opening tomorrow at NÃ¸rrebrogade 62
