Monday mornings can be hard. But we try to make the day a little better by serving some of our healthy and tasty booster bowls like this one with açai. Our açai pulps are of the highest quality imported from Brazil. Known to be rich in antioxidants, omega fatty acids, fibers and vitamins and minerals. At the same time low on carbs. The other thing about açai is that it’s kind of addictive once you’ve first tried it. It’s just waiting for you guys to try it out ❤️😊
