The Lady Of Cofitachequi, India Pale Ale 7% Amager Bryghus Kastrup Denmark in collaboration with Fonta Flora Brewery Morganton NC USA.

And back to the woods.. with the 2nd review of today, a nice collab from Danish Amager with  Fonta Flora from Morganton Western North Carolina led by it's creative mastermind Todd Boera.
Todds vision incl his idea "that fermentation is a away of creating art"
The are Fonta is located played a big part in American history, it was once the chiefdoms of several indian tribes incl one that was lead by female chief that was take prisoner by the Spanish and than again escaped to lead her tribe again. The Spanish had build serveral forts in the area that all where destoryed by "the lady of cofitachequi" as this female chief was called and her tribe.
This way the Spanish could not take over the area and the tribe and the lady kept controling the area and ruling their own land.
This ipa is Amager and Fonta Flora's tribute to the lady.
Like the "Going Oldchool" ipa i reviewed about a month ago, also this Lady of Confitachequi is a classic styled west coast stylish ipa.
And maybe because i am a oldie i stil have a weak spot for ipa's like that, specialy if they are well done.
The beer got some fruity notes of pinepple, orange peel and citrus and a crisp long lasting bitter.
This all makes it a tasty classic styled ipa and as said.. i got a weak spot for such ipa's
Nice job!
Cheers!
