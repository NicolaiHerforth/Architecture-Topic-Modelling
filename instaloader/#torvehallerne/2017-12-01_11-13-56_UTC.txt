Mikkeller A Red & White Christmas (8.0%): Lunchbreak in Denmark, it is 1st of December and it is friday (!!), so it is time to find the best X-mas ale (in Denmark). All X-mas beers are rated up against each other in a X-mas category. Tis Mikkeller has a oatmeal/bread-like thickness, altogether with a great balance between the malty and hoppy flavouring with hints of orange peel, giving both a bitter and sweet aftertaste. Great start of the X-mas category!
#Beerstyle: X-mas (hybrid of Red Ale and Witbier)
