Last meal in CPH at a cute little Taiwanese restaurant near the famous Assisstens Cemetery in Nørrebro - the braised pork rice is basically a hug in a bowl with homemade pickles to add texture and balance out the fattiness of the pork belly. The mixed potstickers (pork, prawn and veg) were sooo juicy in the middle yet super crispy on the outside. And the popcorn chicken were marinaded in traditional Taiwanese spices and herbs, coated with the typical tapioca batter (little on the thick side). #taiwanesefood #streetfood #asianfood #ricebowl #台灣料理 #台灣小吃 #滷肉飯 #滷蛋 #鹽酥雞 #鍋貼 #餃子 #炒青菜 #stirfry #friedchicken #popcornchicken #gyoza #potstickers #dumplings #foodporn #foodheaven #winterwarmer #cozy #hygge #instatravel #adventure #explore #nørrebro #københavn #copenhagen #denmark
