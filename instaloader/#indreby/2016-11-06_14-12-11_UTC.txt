WIN TICKET for the high end fashion show "Laugenes Opvisning" at the VIP event held under the auspices of Her Royal Highness Princess Benedikte, a sister of the Danish Queen.

On Tuesday the 8th of November some of the best tailors, hairdressers, jewellers and other luxury goods creators showcase their best designs at the annual and very prestigious event "Laugenes Opvisning" (show of the guilds). The show takes place in Moltkes Pal√¶ just around the corner of the royal cadtle, Amalienborg.

This is a chance to see some of the best haute couture, high end jewellery etc. which is currently created in Denmark and an event not to be missed by any fashionista!

While you might still be so lucky to get a ticket for the show at 15:30, the VIP show at 18:00, attended by Her Royal Highness Princess Benedikte is completely sold out. BUT you can win one rare ticket for that exact show if you:

We will draw a winner on Monday evening and contact you directly.
