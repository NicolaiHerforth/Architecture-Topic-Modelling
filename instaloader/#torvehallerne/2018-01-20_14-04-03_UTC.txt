Started our day off with some delicious porridge from Grød at Torvehallerne 🥣
Ohhhhh my gosh, if I could buy this in bulk and bring it back to London with me that would be great 👍🏻 seriously my mouth is watering at the thought of how good it was 😍

Hubby & I both went for the ‘make your own’ option - porridge with a choice of 3 toppings.
He (top bowl) had banana, chocolate chips & caramel sauce 
I (bottom bowl) had apple compote, caramel sauce & granola
