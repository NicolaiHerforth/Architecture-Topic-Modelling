Hey everyone xx
I want to tell u guys about last night😍
As some of u might know I went to Reflektor light festival with my mum, in Søndermarken. She doesn't know a lot about photography, but it was nice to have her by my side.❣️
The vibe was so chill and lovely. There was a smell of Coffee☕️ First there was a small welcome speech and after that there was a really intresting speech about the stars and the 'magic' between dark and light. ✨
I was so lucky that I joined the photowalk with @Astridkbh She taught me some photography and instagram hacks. Which I'm really gratefull for.🤘
The light installations were incredible! Every single one of them were unique and super pretty!😍
I took a lot of pictures, most of them were long exposure which is one of my favorite kind of pictures to take.
On the way home, my mum and I talked about how great an evening we've had! It was Nice spending some quality time with her!❣️
Thx to @astridkbh for helping me with this picture 😍❤
