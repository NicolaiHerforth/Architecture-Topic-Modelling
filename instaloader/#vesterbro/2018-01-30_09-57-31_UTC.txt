We're knee-deep in Winter, so coming weeks, you'll get some health(y) survival tips on Tuesdays.
Feeling tired? Low on energy? Down? Bloated? Weak immune system? Personally, I stay far away from caffeinated drinks and coffee in general. My GREEN MONSTER helps almost anything and gives a more balanced kind of energy. Drink it in the morning on an empty stomach. You don't even have to take it everyday, just twice a week or when you feel you need it. You'll feel bright and fresh in no time! Ingredients are:
â€¢ 1/3 pressed ginger
â€¢ 1/3 pressed lemon and lime
â€¢ 1/3 pressed apple juice
â€¢ 1 table spoon spirulina (featured product is just the one I am using now, not sponsored).
