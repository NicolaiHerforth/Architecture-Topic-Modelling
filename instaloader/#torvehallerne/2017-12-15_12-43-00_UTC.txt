This is a massive selection of organic plant mylk. Copenhagen. I love and respect you for being the health food and organic capital of the world. And I am proud to say that my mega bestselling book from 2008 kickstarted this. Because before my book, glutenfree, organic and dairyfree foods were non-existing in Denmark. You CAN change the world just by changing yourself. My book was about how to transform your family through food & lifestyle. Even the union of dairyfarmers interviewed me about how it felt to have minimized sales of dairy in Denmark. Now, my sons and I can get glutenfree, dairyfree, organic food everywhere. #healthycopenhagen #paleo #glutenfree #dairyfree #organic #copenhahen #torvehallerne
