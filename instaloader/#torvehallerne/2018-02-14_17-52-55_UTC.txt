Danish open sandwiches are the epitome of OTT. We got the chicken salad topped with bacon, and Danish meatballs with potato salad. The chicken salad was creamy and rich with plenty of mayo, and served on top of buttered rye bread. The Danish meatballs had a fine but dense constency, similar to meatloaf. Again served with plenty of mayo and buttered bread. I was quick to hop on my bike after this lunch. .

Price💱: 70 dkk per Smørrebrød
Taste🍽: 5/10. I'm a big fan of mayo and butter, but I can't help but feel this was too much. Towards the end, I was really struggling. 
Experience😄: 7/10. The stand is in the cute Torvehallerne food hall, buzzing with food, colours and people. Very fun ambiance. 
Value🦄: 5/10. Definitely gotta try Smørrebrød when in Copenhagen, but keep in mind that it's a cold open faced mayo sandwich, so maybe plan something active after :)
