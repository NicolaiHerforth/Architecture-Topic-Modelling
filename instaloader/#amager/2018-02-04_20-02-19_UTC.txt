It’s been pretty cold here and we had a bit of snow yesterday. That reminded me of this guy, I completely forgot his name but I do remember that his dogs name is Gizmo. I guess I can remember the dogs name because of Gizmo from the old movie Gremlins. But this guy walks his dog every day regardless of the weather wearing only shorts and bare feet in his sandals. He must have a blod cirkulation that is out of this world.
