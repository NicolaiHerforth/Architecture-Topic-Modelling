Spending the rest of my holiday in Copenhagen. And even though we have grey skies and only 20 degrees I have the best of days. Just enjoyed one of my favorite Danish pastries and a lemonade at one of my favorite bakeries in Copenhagen 🦋Torvehallerne is really one of my favorite places to shop in Copenhagen ☀️
