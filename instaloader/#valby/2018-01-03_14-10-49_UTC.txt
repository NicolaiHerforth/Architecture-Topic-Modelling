We are so glad about our coffee tree, which is around 20 years old and makes our roastery and coffee shop way more beautiful. 
We just saw that coffee cherries have started to ripen slowly. Usually, when coffee cherries turn from dark red to purple, they are ready to be picked. The best part is that the dried outer skin of the coffee cherry can be used as a tea, which has a sweet and smooth flavour. Do you want to try it? Pass by our roastery and coffee shop at Langgade st. :)
