I work a lot on my software project at the moment! As many hours as possible during each day, all 7 days of the week! I donâ€™t go out much or see my friends the last year or so! This weekend i took a break and spent the two days with my father listening to the world famous physicist Holger Bech Nielsen, eating a very cold (-200 degrees Celcius) marshmellow and going out with friends. Now for some Sushi and Wonder Woman! ðŸ˜ƒ what a great and much needed break!! ðŸ¤“
