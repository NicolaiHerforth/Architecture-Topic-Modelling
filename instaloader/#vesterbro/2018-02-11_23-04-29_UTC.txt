Spring has sprung in my brothers garden - And so did his chickens after my boy and I accidentally let the dog into the coop... after finally gathering them all back... after accidentally letting them all out of the coop. They love it when we visit. Really. #winteraconite #snowdrops #erantis #vinterg√¶k #mybrother #garden #chickens #hens #chickencoop #suburbia #snow #vegetablegarden #family #visit #vesterbro #copenhagen #denmark #accident #cityslickers #townies #stenbromummy
