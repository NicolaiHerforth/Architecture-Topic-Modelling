Iâ€™ve written another thousand words or so on why I loved visiting Copenhagen. The second instalment of our adventure is now live on lottiehuckle.co.uk and it describes one of the loveliest days Iâ€™ve ever had. There are giants, walking boots, cups of tea, plenty of shots of the dramatic Baltic Sea and some really rather delicious food spots too. You can read the whole story by clicking the link in my profile. ðŸŒ²
